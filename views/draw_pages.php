		<h3>About</h3>
		<p class ="lead box"><em>Lebanese Blogs</em> is the best place to read, discover and share the latest posts from Lebanon's top bloggers</p>

		<p>It was born out of the realization that there must be a more fun way to discover and read blogs and find out what's going on without the guilt of an unread inbox.</p>

		<h3>How does this thing work?</h3>

		<p>There is a database with a list of carefully chosen blogs that is constantly being updated. The database is the basis for a feed fetching script that gathers the latest posts and stores them here for displaying</p>

		<h3>How are blogs chosen?</h3>

		<p>In order to provide the best and most relevant experience to browsers, blogs that are indexed in Lebanese Blogs should satisfy some criteria. The blog has to be related to Lebanon and the blogger has to have a track record sustainable blogging. Read more about these criteria in the "submit" section below.</p>

		<h3>Can I get my blog in there?</h3>

		<p>If you think your blog belongs here and satisfies the criteria, what are you waiting for? Submit it!</p>
		
		<h3>Who is Behind This?</h3>
		<p>My name is <a href ="http://facebook.com/mustapha">Mustapha Hamoui</a>. I design and develop websites as a hobby (a full stack web developer in the jargon). But I'm also a businessman and a blogger.</p>
