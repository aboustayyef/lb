Things to do
============

* Fix Featured Bloggers
  - Make sure buttons work (might involve tinkering with favorites js)
  - Make sure bloggers chosen have recent posts
  - consider using jason for featured blogger (with a cron job to create a featured blogger every twenty minutes)

* Login Page
  - Allow users to press escape to return

* Blogger Page
  - Add a "< - Back to All Blogs" link at the top left, so that people who go straight to bloggers page know that there is a main page.

* Search Page
  - dedupe results (posts with search terms that are both in titles and body are showing twice)
  - still too slow.. Think of dividing the action like previously.

* Javascript rewrite

* cleanup stuff
  - make sure you use the auto-load class
  - in the Posts Class, try to separate post methods from blog methods, and perhaps have a separate class for blogs eventually.

* Make sure admin is working
