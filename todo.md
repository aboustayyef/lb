Things to do
============

* static page. Fix CSS and email sent message; replace modal with confirmation message.

* Fix Featured Bloggers
  - (done) Make sure buttons work (might involve tinkering with favorites js)
  - (done) Make sure bloggers chosen have recent posts
  - (perhaps later) consider using jason for featured blogger (with a cron job to create a featured blogger every twenty minutes)

* Login Page
  - Allow users to press escape to return

* top posts date toggler

* Blogger Page
  - Add a "< - Back to All Blogs" link at the top left, so that people who go straight to bloggers page know that there is a main page.

* Search Page
- refine when possible

* Javascript rewrite
- mostly done

* cleanup stuff
  - make sure you use the auto-load class
  - in the Posts Class, try to separate post methods from blog methods, and perhaps have a separate class for blogs eventually.

* Make sure admin is working
