In the past, the main champion of this idea has been Speaker Nabih Berri, but there has never been an occasion to take the possibility seriously since Lebanon’s electoral laws have generally not departed drastically from precedent. </span></p>\n<p>This year is different. We’ve seen the biggest political parties get behind some outlandish (dare I say unorthodox) schemes. The Christians support <a title=\"What to Read on Lebanon’s Proposed 2013 Electoral Law\" href=\"http://qifanabki.com/2013/02/20/what-to-read-on-lebanons-proposed-2013-electoral-law/\"><strong>a single-district formula</strong></a> that would forbid citizens from voting for anyone but a member of their own sect. The Sunni Future Movement has floated the idea of a <a title=\"Establishing a Lebanese Senate: Bicameralism and the Third Republic\" href=\"http://qifanabki.com/2012/08/23/establishing-a-lebanese-senate-bicameralism-and-the-third-republic/\"><strong>bicameral legislature</strong></a>. And the largest Shiite party has now put forward a “compromise” solution in the form of a single district with no forced confessional voting.</p>\n<p>It seems a safe bet that Hizbullah’s proposal is dead in the water. The Future Movement is unlikely to go for it because they’ll lose seats to Hizbullah under any large district proportional representation model, and the Christians won’t go for it because it maximizes the number of Christian MPs elected by non-Christian voters. What Nasrallah is proposing, in fact, is the exact opposite of what Aoun has proposed, which says something interesting about these two allies’ respective visions of the country.</p>\n<p>But even though the proposal is unlikely to go anywhere, I thought I’d present some observations on what a single national district model might engender. I am indebted to the wisdom of a very savvy expert who would prefer to remain anonymous.</p>\n<p><strong><span>1. What kind of proportional representation are we talking about? </span></strong></p>\n<p>As several commentators have snarkily remarked, it’s a little ironic that Nasrallah’s ideal electoral law resembles the system that exists in Israel (but also recently in Jordan and also in Palestine in 2006). In those contexts, the system used is called “<strong>Closed List PR</strong>,” which means that parties are responsible for ranking their own candidates on a list. Voters basically just go to the polls and cast a single vote for one of the various national lists that are running. Seats are allocated to the various lists in proportion to the votes won. The specific candidates that are chosen from the winning lists are determined by <em>the list’s own ranking of those candidates. </em></p>\n<p>In Lebanon, however, all proposals so far have been for “<strong>Open List PR</strong>,” where voters choose their favored  list but may also give a preferential vote to a specific candidate on that list. Seats are allocated to lists on a proportional basis, but seats are allocated to candidates in the order that they received preferential votes. <em>This approach gives the voters, not the party, the power to determine who wins a seat on a list.</em></p>\n<p>What’s the impact of this in practice? As my informant suggests:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are some technical aspects (imagine the size of a ballot paper for Open List for just 2 lists with 128 candidates each). But the major impact is on how parties prepare lists and campaign. For a Closed List, how do you get someone to agree to be 128th, , or even 40th on a list when there is an absolute certainty of not winning? Who would Aoun choose to be a number 2? This system requires a very different approach to party politics (one that is disciplined and/or democratic) that Lebanon lacks but for one major exception [i.e. Hizbullah]. It also means campaigns are funded by parties/heads of lists/members/donors and not by candidates themselves. Open List creates a different dynamic, as it often means that there’s an internal contest within the list (‘Vote for List A but for me, and not for him’). There’s also the problem of popular leaders, who may win the vast majority of the preferential voters cast on a list, which means that some of that list’s candidates may win a seat despite only winning very few preferential votes.</p>\n<p>The short answer is that Nasrallah probably supports Closed List PR but has not yet been distinct on the matter.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Confessional Quotas</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>In order to maintain a system of confessional quotas within a single national district, you need a special methodology. First, each list would have to contain every confession that has a seat in proportion to the number of seats for each confession (i.e. you could not have a list with more than one Armenian Catholic). Second, there would need to be a mechanism to allocate seats so that it is not just done in terms of the rank order or preferential order, but where there is a rule that a candidate would be skipped if that confession was previously filled.</p>\n<p>In other words, it would be possible for a Greek Catholic candidate (for example) to be elected with fewer votes than a Maronite candidate <em>on the same list</em> if all the Maronite spots had already been filled by candidates who won even more votes than the guy who would be passed over by the Greek Catholic. I have a great diagram someplace that explains this…</p>\n<p>The problem is that in Lebanon there is also the constitutional requirement that the Parliament represent the country both confessionally and geographically, which has traditionally meant that each confessional seat is tied to a specific district. In other words, it’s not just 34 Maronite seats to be included as a quota but 1 Maronite from Akkar, 3 from Zghorta etc.</p>\n<p>Each PR proposal so far has maintained this connection which in effect creates a ‘double quota’, and that is incredibly hard to manage within PR lists for a single national district unless there are requirements for each list to have ‘A Maronite from Akkar’, ‘An Alawite from Akkar’, etc. It’s not clear if Nasrallah is envisaging that there would be such lists, or if he’d support scrapping the district connection altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Thresholds</strong></p>\n<p>The results of a PR system can be significantly impacted by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold\"><strong>election threshold</strong></a> adopted. The common wisdom is that a lower threshold makes it easier for non-mainstream candidates to get elected (which is often code for “liberals and radicals”). My informant clarifies:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You don’t need a threshold as PR always creates a natural threshold with the electoral quotient (e.g. in 2009, to win a seat: 1,734,029 voter turnout divided by 128 seats = 13,548 electoral quotient. It’s worth noting that Lady Geagea won a seat with just 13,066 in 2009.) But a threshold is useful to ensure that there are not too many small parties. Israel now has a 2% threshold above which a party qualifies for a seat. In 2009, that would have meant a list would need 34,680 to win a seat. That’s more than what Aoun got to win a seat in Kerswan.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Full Lists or Partial Lists?</strong></p>\n<p>One issue that always comes up in discussions of single national districts is whether one would have to field a full list in order to compete in the election. Obviously, putting together a list of 128 candidates is a very difficult thing to do for any organization that is not already a mainstream political party. This is why in many countries with single-district PR systems, you do not need to submit a full list. In Lebanon, however, the confessional quotas create complexities for allowing partial lists.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the issues that should be discussed in any national conversation about a single national district.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5333/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5333/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=qifanabki.com&blog=4404162&post=5333&subd=qifanabki&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

I once bought a pair of Wang heels that I was able to wear once. I usually have no problem walking in heels, but I could barely make it through the night with the ones I have. I look at these new Balenciaga models and I already know how uncomfortable walking in these heels will be. </p>\n<p>For starters, a low-cut pointy front is not flattering at all. I’ve heard its called “toe cleavage” and now I hate it even more. Besides that, a thong extends from the base of the heel to the ankle- that’s going to cause pulling on the toes. The more the foot slips forward (knowing that you’re in heels and most likely it will), the more the thong is going to hurt the toes. I appreciate the creativity and the effort put to CREATE a new idea, but I just personally don’t think these anyone can tolerate walking in any of these four models. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/6e2e511435bb5677cf4ae84700e92b68/tumblr_inline_mj1goi6gsI1qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>'),

Very few nations today, if any, have fully armed soldiers patrolling the streets in this way, or directing traffic, or walking through a nightlife district.

However, it does raise some great points.</p>\n<p>This video is a live example on how religious books might not have been meant to be taken literally. You are not bound to what your holy book LITERALLY says, unless you want to shut-off your logic portal. You rather interpret the meaning and analyze the metaphors to derive lessons.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s put the concept of blasphemy aside and ask with an open mind</strong>: What is God? Does God need to be seen as a physiologically human-like entity? What if God is an energy? What if God is a fundamental mathematical formula that runs our universe?  What if God is within us and within everything? Is God a mean for us to spiritually connect with everything around us? Would God exist without a purpose?</p>\n<p>I did some research and I saw that, to my surprise, a lot of people have been talking about this and attributing it to many theories worth deliberating. I’m digging into the ‘fundamental mathematical formula’ theories at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s an idea:</strong> If God wanted humanity to have a holy book that would  last for thousands of years (or more), would that book contain literal information? The obvious answer is No. Societies are always changing; what literally applies at one time will not apply in the other. It’s time we take the historical context into consideration and look into the metaphors.</p>\n<p>That’s the way I see it, at least. Any thoughts?</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Q. What is God? Does It have a form or look like paintings of God that we see?</em><br><em>M. Like Michelangelo’s God! No, this is his God, it is Michelangelo’s God. You want to see what God looks like? Who is it who asked this question? Please raise your hand. I will show you immediately. You? Look behind you, your neighbors in front, to your right and left, that is what God looks like. Alright, you are satisfied? God said, “God made man in His own image.” So if you want to find God, look at your neighbors. Each one of us houses God inside. So see through the physical wall and then you will find God in yourself and in each other. So treat each other as God, and then you will see how much different life is day after day’.</em><span> <em>- <a href=\"http://www.godsdirectcontact.com/teachings/AZGodQA.html\">Source</a></em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Hmm, I hope Sheikh Assir would give these thoughts some time.</em></p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://mokhlibnene.wordpress.com/category/religion/\">Religion</a>  <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mokhlibnene.wordpress.com&blog=32724713&post=1283&subd=mokhlibnene&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

They constitute a supportive group and with time become family; especially if you live alone and/or abroad. It’s an essential and healthy pillar of anyone’s social life.</p>\n<p>With people being at work all the time and following up on daily necessities, some of us have decided that one hand can clap alone… if you hit it on a hard surface. Ouch. But it technically does and could hurt but it does not have to be this way.</p>\n<p>The solo bear geeks could also benefit from having friends for a myriad of reasons but making friends will not happen on its own nor by magic. It’s a initiative one needs to take: create the time and effort to work on it.</p>\n<p>Face to face contact will have to start by leaving the laptop at home, go out and and work on “offline friends”. Speaking the solo bear geeks here: you can start by visiting places that you like where you have the highest probability of meeting people who share your interest. Then you can initiate a conversation randomly and see who keeps up and take it from there. It might not work from the first time yet you do not lose anything if you give it a try. You don’t need complicated scenarios and mysterious schemes.</p>\n<p>This is how it worked for me, well almost… I actually bumped into someone while at the library where I used to spend my “offline” time (Don’t read and walk <img src=\"http://ritakml.info/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\"icon razz Friends for life\" title=\"icon razz photo\"> ) and almost fought over a book (Written by Stephen King; I still remember!).

What I haven’t been busy doing is taking pictures of everything that I’ve made. I’m starting to get a backlog of finished objects and I really wanted to document everything, so I wore this red dress today so I could photograph it. Luckily the weather was just perfect for both the dress and taking photos.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Sew U babydoll by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8518624958/\"><img alt=\"Sew U babydoll\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8518624958_64e0077d2e_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"></a></p>\n<p>I finished this dress from the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sew-Home-Stretch-Sewing-Fabrics/dp/0316118370\">Sew U Home Stretch</a> just after Valentine’s Day (great timing, right?) and this is my second time wearing it.

Nevertheless, optimism, transparency and perseverance are in my opinion good enough resources to drive any change or reform in Lebanon or in any country, provided that you have a pragmatic approach and a feasible plan.</p>\n<p>Among the many challenges that Lebanon is faced with today, I believe the biggest and most important is the internet as we are missing out on a major digital revolution and have a lot to lose here. Added to that, and as so <a href=\"http://beirutspring.com/blog/2013/02/18/a-lot-to-lose/\">eloquently put by my friend Mustapha</a>, skipping a technology generation might have “potentially disastrous consequences to the competitiveness of our workforce, a problem that not only is not being acknowledged but that we have absolutely no plans to address”.</p>\n<p><strong>My Idea</strong><br>\nHaving said that, what I want to propose is a 3-steps plan that will hopefully bring the internet revolution to the Lebanese community, more specifically to its young and promising generations, and at the same time speed the process of reform and increased transparency in the country. I am personally not a fan of big ideas, and I wouldn’t have proposed this if I didn’t think it was feasible on the short run and more importantly sustainable, knowing how complicated and corrupt things are in Lebanon. Added to that and this is quite sad, a good project initiated by one minister or government in Lebanon may be discontinued by the next one for pure political reasons, which is why I tried to involve the private sector as much as possible into my idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Step1: Come up with New ISP</strong><br>\nLebanon’s population is a young one just like most countries in the Middle East and those who are most affected by this technological gap nowadays are students in schools and universities as they are the ones who will be shaping the future of Lebanon and forming its new workforce. Having said that, the time required to upgrade all of Lebanon’s network and provide unlimited, abundant and cheap internet to all the Lebanese seems a bit far-fetched at the moment. At the same time, coming up with digital districts in Beirut strictly (to be followed by other districts in keys cities) will create a gap between the Lebanese themselves, in addition to the technological gap we are all living, which is unfair and unacceptable. For that purpose, I recommend creating a new ISP by the Telecom Ministry linked to a non-profit organization or entity. This ISP will be solely dedicated to serving educational settings at a first stage which I will discuss in Step2.</p>\n<p><strong>Step2: Turning Universities and Schools into Internet Villages</strong><br>\nSchools and universities are the places where companies go to recruit young and promising talents and this is where we should have ASAP <strong>Innovation centers or internet villages</strong> equipped with the best material and the best internet out there. I am talking fiber optics, 4G connectivity, rooms for e-lectures and the latest laptops/servers/tablets. The role of the ISP created above will be to provide quick and unlimited internet on campuses and have them always up to date and coping with the digital revolution. The infrastructural requirements will be minimal at this point as the ministry will be catering to a relatively small crowd and the hardware and software equipments will be provided and sponsored (up to a certain percentage) by top-notch US companies. I believe we have enough contacts to get large corporations to provide us with their latest products for a competitive price, if not for free. It is very important here to have proper maintenance contracts with these companies in order not to end up with outdated pcs.</p>\n<p>My idea will apply to both public and private establishments. These tech hubs will serve as a space for students to express their creativity, be innovative and follow up on what’s happening in the world. </p>\n<p><strong>Step3: Expand to Towns and Cities</strong><br>\nI remember almost 10 years ago when internet was still very expensive, internet cafes started popping everywhere in Lebanon offering cheap prices. When internet prices were cut down, cafes started disappearing slowly. Similarly, people want high-speed connections these days and after providing them for free in universities and schools, municipalities should initiate such projects and have one tech center or more in their towns. There are tons of partnerships that can be done here to provide the equipment and e-learning courses could be provided as well to those interested.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I am hoping by the time we reach this stage that our infrastructure will be ready to serve all the Lebanese fast, consistent and unlimited internet but if it is not the case, these centers will help speed this process up even further..</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Technology is turbocharging transparency to fight corruption – Bono – </strong><br>\nI posted few days ago about UK Ambassador in Lebanon Tom Fletcher’s views on the many challenges that await Lebanon and I was captivated by one of his quotes that went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>How do you skip a technology generation? Traffic lights, the internet and electricity are great British inventions. Put them in, and the rest will follow – HA Tom Fletcher</p></blockquote>\n<p>The digital era is revolutionizing our societies and the rise of social media and its influence are turning countries upside down. The more internet is easily accessible and widespread in Lebanon, the more influential the online society is becoming and the bigger impact it is having on the decision-makers and people in power. Given that we are a young country and that the aspiring generations are the ones mostly hooked on social media tools and the internet, empowering them the soonest is a must in order to avoid irrevocable consequences and pave the way for ambitious and competitive innovations such as the proposed flying cars or robotized policemen. Trust me I would be the happiest person in the world if I could fly over traffic on my way to work everyday.</p>\n<p>I’d like to hear your feedback on the above idea even if I am submitting this as is. I barely had a day to prepare this in order to meet the deadline, so I am sure there’s some room for improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>PS: This is my entry for the competition run by the Lebanese Telecom Ministry: “<a href=\"http://www.reinventingtheworld.net/\">Lebanese Bloggers Reinvent The World</a>”.</strong></p>'),

Yet, they pay themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars, forever, for not even doing their jobs we pay them for.</p>\n<p>I’m not voting this election. I suggest any candidate dreaming of a vote from me, and maybe many like me, is a pledge from said candidate to stop paying salaries for MPs that are not in elected office anymore, and stop providing them with scores of police officers as personal bodyguards, chauffeurs and valet parking and instead focus on directing traffic, solving kidnapping cases and trying to turn Roumieh from a 5-star accommodation facility for alleged terror suspects into a proper jail, with a proper trail. You know, one with no WiFi and cable TV and mobile phones…</p>\n<p>Of course, they need to pledge loads of other things, but this one thing is inspired from this rude, disgusting misappropriation of funds from people who need it, to billionaire bags of human feces we vote for every 4 years.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/a-wounded-woman-is-carried-at-the-site-of-an-explosion-in-ashrafieh/\" title=\"A wounded woman is carried at the site of an explosion in Ashrafieh\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"105\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wounded-woman-carried-site.jpg?w=150&h=105\" alt=\"A wounded woman is carried at the site of an explosion in Ashrafieh\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/lebanon-unrest-explosion-2/\" title=\"LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lebanese-workers-firefighters-site.jpg?w=150&h=112\" alt=\"LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/a-woman-is-helped-by-a-lebanese-soldier-after-an-explosion-in-ashafriyeh-district/\" title=\"A woman is helped by a Lebanese soldier after an explosion in Ashafriyeh district\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"103\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/woman-helped-lebanese-explosion.jpg?w=150&h=103\" alt=\"A woman is helped by a Lebanese soldier after an explosion in Ashafriyeh district\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/lebanon-unrest/\" title=\"LEBANON-UNREST\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/security-forces-workers-gather.jpg?w=150&h=112\" alt=\"LEBANON-UNREST\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/lebanon-unrest-explosion/\" title=\"LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"108\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lebanese-forensic-security-forces.jpg?w=150&h=108\" alt=\"LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION\"></a>\n\n<p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12295/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12295/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12295&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p>'),

And like anyone living in this country the thought of  someone with her judgement in parliament terrifies me. And no I’m not gonna jump on the let’s hate on Myriam Klink bandwagon, I’m guessing she has enough of those.</p>\n<p>To me the idea of giving power to a woman with such heinous fashion taste,  bad PR and disastrous image management decisions to make vital decisions on a national level makes me slightly uneasy. I’m sure you can relate.</p>\n<p>I watched her on AlJadeed’s new show <strong>Al Za3eem “الزعيم”</strong> which seems like an Arab Idol for aspiring politicians who present themselves in front of a panel of judges and get eliminated accordingly. (a very badly produced concept and show might I add.)</p>\n<p>Contestants were tested on their speech skills. Some yelled, others threatened, a few seemed to think they were auditioning for a cheesy Lebanese play only to get royally butchered by the panel of judges who showed no mercy.</p>\n<p>And then there was Klink. She stood there, fully clothed, looking mighty professional and gave a very well-rehearsed speech ( you’ll be surprised how good she was compared to the rest) with dramatic and funny hand gestures on two issues she plans to run on. Her first choice impressed me. The environment. She seemed to have a special relationship with nature as her <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/MyriamKlinkPage\">Facebook bio</a> puts it so eloquently</p>\n<p><i>“Myriam Klink is a Lebanese girl from the mountains raised between animals and natures by a loving dad and grand pa who teach her the meaning of respecting life in all its ways….”</i></p>\n<p>But then she said the words I dreaded. Something about women, their rights and well she summed it up with something along the lines of <em>“men have to not forget that they all came from women!”</em>  You know, just in case some men were doubting the birds and bees theory.</p>\n<p>But I’m approaching this with an open mind. Of course I’ve made prejudgments based on everything I see about Klink online; the distasteful photos, her obnoxious behavior and the baffling video clips. Does she stand a real chance of winning? Probably not. But could this be her moment to give us something more than Made In Lebanon Paris Hilton, and perhaps even use her star power to bring attention to issues that should really be high on this country’s priority list such as our depleting environment and animal rights? Perhaps. As long as she steers clear from women’s rights.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Myriam Klink AlJadeed New TV 2\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-2.jpg?w=500&h=426\" width=\"500\" height=\"426\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv.jpg\"><img alt=\"Myriam Klink AlJadeed New TV\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv.jpg?w=500&h=341\" width=\"500\" height=\"341\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"Myriam Klink AlJadeed New TV 3\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-3.jpg?w=500&h=345\" width=\"500\" height=\"345\"></a></p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ivysays.wordpress.com/5177/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ivysays.wordpress.com/5177/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ivysays.com&blog=11241585&post=5177&subd=ivysays&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

Have you?” I replied.<br>\n“Not yet. But man, I can’t believe how anyone would fathom being with Hariri after it!”<br>\n“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll read it when part 2 is released.”</p>\n<p>Part 2 is currently in the works as a reply to part 1.</p>\n<p>FPMers are having a field day with a recently released book from their MPs, mainly Ibrahim Kenaan which revealed “for the first time ever” some secrets about the Hariri era in Lebanese politics. You can buy the book for $8 at any bookstore. It has more tables in it than a Certified Public Accountant would like to handle and its purpose is more than clear: serve as pre-electoral political propaganda, as is their right. </p>\n<p>They have begun to use the term “<em>ebra2ihom al mousta7il</em>” to categorize the Future Movement on their Facebook pages and political websites.</p>\n<p>My premise isn’t about the book’s content. It’s about the point behind the book. Who among us does not know that the Hariri era of politics was riddled with corruption? Well, if you don’t now you do. And if you don’t think it did, then your conviction borders on the delusional.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend for a moment that Hariri was the only person running the show from the 1990 to 2005, his government not having any other participant, and ask the following: don’t FPM ministers have their own “ebra2 l mousta7il” from 2005 onwards?</p>\n<p>A Western company is suing Gebran Bassil for the way he handled one of the many bids that pass under his ministry. Isn’t that corruption?<br>\nThe following <a href=\"http://www.14march.org/news-details.php?nid=NDI1Nzg0\">link</a> portrays severe transgressions of Minister Bassil and Layoun (minister of culture) in Batroun, which MTV is currently investigating, whereby the ministry of culture takes over old Lebanese houses for a very cheap amount of money, gets Gebran to renovate them and sell them for massive amounts. Or how about the diesel scandal that took place last year?</p>\n<p>We can also talk about minister Layoun’s disgusting practices in the minister of culture, from allowing the demolishing of the Roman hippodrome to the Phoenician port to many of Beirut’s old houses, including Amin Maalouf’s. How about we look at Layoun’s wealth before and after him taking on the mantle of the ministry?</p>\n<p>The aforementioned transgressions are based on a few minutes of research here and there that I, a blogger who doesn’t register on our politicians’ radar, was able to pull off.</p>\n<p>FPMers will dismiss this previous <a href=\"http://www.14march.org/news-details.php?nid=NDI1Nzg0\">link</a> immediately based on its source, as will those who are against the FPM will dismiss their book because their source is very political. </p>\n<p><em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> is not a book for the Lebanese masses because you can’t offer one side of the corruption story in Lebanese politics and expect people who differ from you politically to take you seriously. I will not read <em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> because, despite keeping an open mind (most of the time) to different scenarios in the country, I know for a fact that the other side which the book doesn’t portray, obviously, committed transgressions that may or may not be as severe as the side the book does, in fact, portray. But that’s not the point.</p>\n<p>The point is that every single political party in this country has, upon reaching power committed corrupt acts. The point is that blaming the entire country’s financial and economic problems, through a book such as <em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> on one single politician and his party, however corrupt that politician was, is illogical and non-sensical.</p>\n<p><em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> is a book that will get those who support the FPM to support the party even further without even reading the book. Let’s be honest, most FPMers won’t read it and will count on their politicians telling them what the book contains. Those who are against the FPM will dismiss it as nonsense. And come election time, no one will really remember it.</p>\n<p>And the merry goes round. </p>\n<p>Hariri was corrupt, sure. But Hariri was not the only one who’s corrupt. People with glass houses should not throw stones. Everyone has their own <em>ebra2 al mousta7il</em>.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/elections-2013/\">Elections 2013</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/politics-2/\">Politics</a> Tagged: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/al-ebra2-el-mousta7il/\">Al Ebra2 El Mousta7il</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/aoun/\">Aoun</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/corruption/\">corruption</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/fpm/\">FPM</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/gaby-layoun/\">Gaby Layoun</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/gebran-bassil/\">Gebran Bassil</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/hariri/\">Hariri</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%84/\">الإبراء المستحيل</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=6882&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

السفير دانيال بنجامين في خضم لقائه مع نظرائه السوريين في دمشق في فبراير 2010، كجزء من «سياسة الانخراط» مع نظام بشار الاسد، عند دخول ضابط رفيع المستوى وقف له الحاضرون. «علي مملوك»، قدم احد المشاركين الضابط المذكور. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nتفاصيل اللقاء، الذي شهد مشاركة غير متوقعة من «مدير امن الدولة» السوري في حينه، ظهرت الى العلن في برقية ديبلوماسية سرية الى واشنطن، كشف عنها موقع «ويكيليكس» في ما بعد، وورد فيها ان مملوك قال للزائر الاميركي ان بلاده لطالما كانت «اكثر نجاحا من الولايات المتحدة والدول الاخرى في المنطقة في مكافحة الارهاب لاننا لا نهاجمهم ونقتلهم فورا، بل نخترقهم، ولا نتحرك الا في اللحظة المناسبة».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nطبعا لم يكن بنجامين يتصور ان نجاح مملوك الباهر يعني ان نظام الاسد سيستخدم مقاتلات «ميغ» وصواريخ «سكود» لقتل اكبر عدد ممكن من معارضي استمرار حكم الاسد. ولم يكن بنجامين يتصور كذلك ان الرجل نفسه الذي كانت واشنطن تسعى الى التعامل معه من اجل «مكافحة الارهاب» سينتهي به المطاف على لائحة «الارهابيين» المطلوبين في الولايات المتحدة والاتحاد الاوروبي.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nحتى في لبنان، اصدر القضاء مذكرة توقيف بحق مملوك بتهمة تزويده الوزير اللبناني السابق ميشال سماحة بعبوات لاستهداف شخصيات سنية في شمال لبنان بهدف اثارة النعرات وإشعال الاقتتال الطائفي. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nمنذ اندلاع الثورة السورية في مارس 2011، انقلبت الصورة. سماحة اصبح في السجن، ومملوك نال ترقية ليخلف هشام بختيار، الذي قضى في تفجير قام به الثوار، «رئيسا لمكتب الامن القومي» لنظام الاسد. اما بنجامين، فخرج من الوزارة مع خروج الوزيرة هيلاري كلينتون.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nفي السنوات الثلاث الماضية، الصورة انقلبت في واشنطن كذلك. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nعندما التقى بنجامين مملوك، لم يتطرق المسؤول الاميركي، خريج جامعة هارفرد المرموقة والمتخصص في شؤون التطرف الاسلامي وخصوصا في باكستان وافغانستان، الى مجموعات تعتبرها واشنطن ارهابية، مثل «حزب الله» اللبناني. سلم بنجامين مملوك لائحة من الاسماء لـ «ارهابيين» مطلوبين للولايات المتحدة ينتمون الى «تنظيم القاعدة» او التنظيمات التابعة له.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nقبل العام 2011، كان للارهاب في واشنطن مذهب واحد، وكان امثال سماحة يقودون حملة اعلامية لاقناع اميركا والغرب ان كل اتباع هذا المذهب، أكانوا متطرفين او معتدلين، هم ارهابيون، وان مصلحة الغرب هي في التعاون مع الاسد، وربما ايران و«حزب الله»، للقضاء عليهم.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nفي العام 2007، في خضم المواجهة بين الجيش اللبناني و«تنظيم فتح الاسلام» في مخيم اللاجئين الفلسطينيين «نهر البارد» في شمال لبنان، نشرت مجلة «نيويوركر» الرصينة مقالا للكاتب سيمور هيرش نقل فيه عن العميل السابق في الاستخبارات البريطانية اليستر كروك قوله التالي: «قيل لي انه في غضون 24 ساعة (علي قيام تنظيم فتح الاسلام)، توالت عليهم عروض المال والتسليح من اشخاص قدموا انفسهم كممثلين لمصالح الحكومة اللبنانية، افتراضا حتى يشنوا حربا ضد حزب الله».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nهذا التصريح تلقفه مسؤولو «حزب الله» وحلفاؤهم اللبنانيون لاتهام رئيس حكومة لبنان في حينه فؤاد السنيورة، ورئيس كتلة «المستقبل» النيابية في ذلك الحين سعد الحريري، بدعم «التطرف الاسلامي في لبنان»، وتم تداول مقالة هيرش على نطاق واسع في لبنان والعواصم الغربية.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nوفي وقت لاحق، تبين ان هيرش كان من اصدقاء سماحة، الذي قدمه الى كروك الذي يدير مركزا للابحاث في بيروت مقربا من «حزب الله»، وان التقرير كان جزءا من عملية اعلامية محكمة يقودها سماحة، العامل بامرة مملوك، وحليف «حزب الله».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nلكن الثورة السورية قلبت الصورة في سورية ولبنان، كما في واشنطن.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nاول من امس، تصدرت الصفحة الاولى لصحيفة «واشنطن بوست» مقالة اعتبرت ان «حزب الله» يعمل على توسيع نشاطاته للقيام بهجمات في عواصم غربية، ووردت فيها تفاصيل التحقيقات القبرصية مع عضو الحزب الموقوف حسام يعقوب. كما تطرقت المقالة الى امكانية مشاركة الحزب بتفجير بلغاريا، وموضوع موافقة الاتحاد الاوروبي على وضع الحزب على لائحة التنظيمات الارهابية بعد سنوات طويلة من مقاومة الضغط الاميركي في هذا الشأن.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nوقبل اسبوع، نشرت مجلة «نيويوركر» نفسها مقالة حملت عنوان «ان سقط نظام الاسد، هل يمكن لحزب الله الاستمرار؟».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nهذه المرة لم يتمكن سماحة المسجون من التأثير في ما تنشره المجلة الاميركية، او مقالها الذي كتبه ديكستر فيلكنز، الذي اجرى مقابلة مع مسؤول عسكري في «حزب الله»، واطلق عليه اسما مستعارا هو داني. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nيقول فيلكنز ان «امكانية غالبية سنية او حتى نظام اصولي، يأتي الى الحكم في سورية بدت مرعبة الى درجة ان داني بدا وكأنه صار يؤيد اسرائيل». يقول داني، حسب فيلكنز، «اذا ما استولى السنة على سورية، فسوف نقاتلهم في بيروت».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nوينقل فيلكنز عن امل سعد غريب، التي كانت تقدم نفسها في الماضي القريب على انها باحثة محايدة وتعمل مع «مركز ابحاث كارنيغي» الاميركي في بيروت، قولها: «اذا ما فازوا ورحلت حكومة الاسد، فاتصور انهم سيحاولون نزع سلاح حزب الله». وتضيف سعد غريب، التي يصفها فيلكنز بالكاتبة المقربة من قادة «حزب الله»، ان الحزب «سوف يضطر الى الدفاع عن نفسه».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nفي هذه الاثناء، شارك السفير بنجامين في لقاء حواري في «معهد واشنطن لدراسات الشرق الادنى» اعتبر خلاله ان نشاط «حزب الله» خارج الشرق الاوسط وصل الى مراحل غير مسبوقة منذ التسعينات. وقال بنجامين ان هذا الحزب «لا يقوم بهجمات متفرقة، بل متورط حاليا في حملة ارهابية» من اجل «تحذير الغرب ضد قيامه بأي تدخل عسكري في ايران».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nواوضح بنجامين: «حزب الله يعتقد اننا اصلا في صراع، ولكنهم يريدون ان يوصلوا الينا رسالة عما يمكنهم القيام به في حال تطور الصراع».</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nاذا الصورة في واشنطن تغيرت جذريا في السنوات القليلة الاخيرة. اللوبي الذي كان يقوده سماحة داخل العاصمة الاميركية تضعضع. كروك، الذي زار اميركا مرارا لتسويق كتابه ونظريته القائلة بضرورة تحالف اميركا مع «محور الشمال» المؤلف من ايران والعراق وتركيا وسورية ولبنان، لم يعد مرحبا به. هيرش منشغل عن الشرق الاوسط بنقاشات مع اميركيين حول شؤون داخلية يعقدها بشكل شبه يومي في فندق «تابارد ان» حيث

An act of violence disturbs the lives of the group and they come to realize how precious love and family can be. Leila (Darine Hamze) tries to escape from her abusive husband (Hassan Farhat) in hopes of fleeing to Detroit, where her sister Rola (Christine Solomon) lives. Lisa is desperately seeking a divorce from her husband Sam (Derek Kelly) in order to pursue a Hollywood career. She claims her husband physically abuses her in order to get Sam deported from the States. Rola, who is married to a successful lawyer Joe (Tamer Werfalli), both strives to help their friend Sam (Derek Kelly) and her sister’s marriage while struggling to have a baby of their own. Betroit addresses issues of domestic violence, culture, love and relationships between both the American and Middle Eastern culturet.</p></blockquote>\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LIXpCDNo224\" height=\"338\" width=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></center> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Plus961/~4/cBf2vsLr7EY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">'),

Across multiple disciplines, from history to literature, religious studies to philosophy, archaeology to music, scholars are tapping the extraordinary power of digital technologies to preserve, curate, analyze, visualize, and reconstruct their research objects.</p>\n<p>The humanistic study of the Middle East and the broader Islamic world has been no less impacted by this new paradigm. Scholars are making daily use of digital tools and repositories including private and state-sponsored archives of textual sources, digitized manuscript collections, densitometrical imaging, visualization and modeling software, and various forms of data mining and analysis. However, there have been few calls to bring researchers together to showcase their experiments in digital humanistic scholarship within their respective fields, or to discuss the opportunities and challenges engendered by this changing scholarly ecosystem.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, <a href=\"http://www.middleeastbrown.org/\"><strong>Middle East Studies at Brown University</strong></a> – with the support of the Brown Humanities Initiative – is pleased to announce a pioneering conference on October 24-25 2013 that will explore the state of the art in digital scholarship pertaining to Islamic & Middle East Studies. Some of the guiding questions we are interested in include:</p>\n<p>(1) Where are the most important digitization projects of historical sources in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and other languages taking place around the world?</p>\n<p>(2) What kinds of digital technologies and methodologies have proven most fruitful for scholars in different disciplines (e.g. data mining, pattern recognition, social network analysis, etc.)?</p>\n<p>(3) How are existing technologies challenged by the manipulation of data in non-Western languages, and what are the most significant technological desiderata for researchers?</p>\n<p>(4) As digital tools and media become more widespread, what ethical issues relating to privacy and human consent must be carefully considered, particularly in projects involving contemporary political and social issues?</p>\n<p>We are happy to welcome as our keynote speaker <strong>Dr. Dwight Reynolds</strong> (Professor of Religious Studies, UCSB), who is among many other things the architect of the Sirat Bani Hilal Digital Archive, “an open access resource for the preservation and dissemination of audio recordings, written texts, photographic images and other materials related to the Epic of the Bani Hilal Tribe,” a thousand-year-old epic poem. The conference will be webcast and several papers may be selected for publication in an edited volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Submissions:</strong> We welcome submissions from scholars and graduate students in diverse disciplines. Interested candidates are kindly requested to submit a title and abstract of 300 words to the conference organizers at digitalhumanitiesconference {at} gmail {dot} com. The deadline for submissions is <strong>April 1st, 2013</strong>, and successful applicants will be notified by mid-April. Papers should be no longer than 20 minutes and should be read in English.</p>\n<p>Depending on the number of participants, <em><strong>there will be limited funds available for travel and accommodation</strong></em>. Brown University is located in Providence, Rhode Island, about one hour south of Boston. For any questions, please contact Dr. Elias Muhanna at the email address above. Additional information will soon be available on the conference website.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5325/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5325/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=qifanabki.com&blog=4404162&post=5325&subd=qifanabki&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

Various individuals and groups effectively claim existence, label their territories, as well as write and re-write their histories — Lebanon has no one history. I refer to this as a “debate” because of this back and forth, of placement and replacement, which lies in stark contrast to the monologue that rises above buildings and highways, the one-way beaming of high-priced messages as represented by billboards and advertising space.</p>\n<p>Recently, these two “conversational” spaces have mixed, if not melded — with corporate messengers vying for equal footing with straightforward political, theological and economic discourses. On closer inspection, however, they are unequal: messages moving from the street upwards have a rebellious aim; those moving from the ad space down have a much more sinister source.</p>\n<p><b>Independence ‘05</b></p>\n<p>On March 14, 2005, a large percentage of the Lebanese population hit the streets of Beirut, protesting Syrian domination of its political and economic infrastructures. The demonstrations, which arose after the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, coincided with the almost immediate emergence of “Independence ‘05” banners, stickers and other merchandise like flags and hats. Designed collectively by some of Beirut’s top ad agency talents, the red, white and green logo soon appeared everywhere [see Fig. 1]. Not missing a beat, the U.S. State Department renamed the locally known Intifada of Independence as the Cedar Revolution, and for a brief time, to the outside world at least, it seemed that Lebanon was going down the road paved by other “branded” revolutions, such as those in Georgia and Ukraine also underwritten by American NGOs.</p>\n<p>The manufactured logo’s invasion was striking during those first weeks of co-opted activism, its pre-packaged message disseminating rapidly through the streets. Eventually, Syria withdrew its troops, and by the time Christmas arrived, Dar an-Nahar (the publishing arm of <i>an-Nahar</i> newspaper) came out with a glossy coffee-table book documenting The Beirut Spring — complete with a kit of patriotic artifacts — almost as if to say, yet again: “Mission Accomplished!”</p>\n<p>For the past two years, however, a series of bombings, assassinations and all-out warfare has redefined those original ideas of “Independence” and has led to the surreal situation where the absence of dialogue on the governmental level is contrasted by an endless stream of mediated messages.</p>\n<p>Since Israel’s war against Lebanon last summer, these different levels of discourse — street and ad, local and global — have scrambled for prominence. Advertisers, mostly banks, plastered the country with ads touting their role in rebuilding; Johnnie Walker, among many others, made reference to the destruction of the country’s infrastructure in both its imagery and ad copy [see Fig. 2]. The line between advertising and public expression often blurred: billboards for General Michel Aoun’s Free Patriotic Movement featured “hand-drawn” orange checkmarks, only to be rivaled by huge “homemade” banners — mostly featuring Condoleezza Rice as purveyor of bombs for Lebanese children or as schoolmarm to Prime Minister Fouad Siniora — draped across buildings downtown.</p>\n<p>Likewise, in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs, another advertising campaign had taken shape, startling in its assimilation of these “designed messages” and distance from the insular iconography and Arabic-only statements formerly seen on the ground. Aimed at international journalists, it documented the wholesale destruction of entire neighborhoods with a retort of victory — Nasr min Allah or “Divine Victory” — playing on the name of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. These banners, in French, English and Arabic, and featuring other messages such as “The New Middle (B)east,” were hung from every building even remotely left standing [see Fig. 3].</p>\n<p>The political dialogue that should have been taking place on a national and international level has been reduced to empty sound bites by agencies such as Saatchi & Saatchi and H&C Leo Burnett, which made sectarianism its target in a new campaign for <i>al-Mujtamah al-Madani</i> (Civil Society). The first run of print ads featured personalized objects like mailboxes, doctors’ office signs and license plates, identifying not only names and numbers but also sect affiliation, a commentary on the factional system that governs all aspects of Lebanese life [see Figs. 4-5].</p>\n<p>In corresponding television spots, actors representing other countries proudly declare, in their respective languages: <i>Je suis francais</i>, and “I am an American” [see Fig. 6]. Yet the Lebanese claim: <i>Ana Sunni</i>, <i>Ana Shi’i</i>, <i>Ana Dirzi</i>, and <i>Ana Marounieh</i>, not <i>Ana Lubnani</i> (“I am Lebanese”). Shots ring out, and our Lebanese protagonists are left with their heads hanging in shame [see Fig. 7]. The ads seem to blame the Lebanese population itself for its “backwards” nature instead of blaming the outside political and economic forces that have long imposed those divisions, and offer an ignominious, orientalist cliche that is absurd in its reduction and shamefully outdated in its casting of a blond-haired, blue-eyed man as the American. Are Americans not multicultural? Do they not take pride in their own hyphenated identities?</p>\n<p>Another advertising project reminiscent of the “Independence ‘05” campaign appeared as well, featuring “martyr” Christmas trees, trilingual billboards and mobile ad trucks animated by live actors, broadcasting the message: “I love life” [see Fig. 8]. The slogan is offensive in its equation of the Shi’a of Lebanon as, culturally speaking, “lovers of death.” <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article6364.shtml\">Further research revealed it to be a campaign sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)</a> and reflective of other U.S.-sponsored initiatives in Ukraine and Africa.</p>\n<p>In this world of meta-communication, the reality of the situation becomes increasingly obfuscated. What the West interprets as a clash of civilizations is really about class differences — the haves and the have-nots, capital and labor, the first world and the other four-fifths of the planet. Seen through these advertising campaigns, “America” and “Democracy” — and by extension, free-market capitalism — become simply a product to sell, a brand to push, and logically (and cynically), advertisers have been hired to do the job. The greater problem for the pushers of the product is that the peoples of the world have grown wise to the pitch — especially when those pushing this local variant of the global “brand,” Saatchi & Saatchi, are simultaneously working on the rebranding of Israel, to create a “narrative of normalcy” after the war this past summer.</p>\n<p><b>“You say you want a revolution…”</b></p>\n<p>In the past, brand identity was based intrinsically on the notion of an untarnished image. Trying to sell something that was below par was once considered hucksterism; salesmen thereof were seen as peddling snake oil. So ingrained is this accepted notion of pushing a lie that it is part of American folklore and imbedded in its culture, seen in everything from tall tales and <i>The Music Man</i> to the infomercials of Ron Popeil.</p>\n<p>As free-market capitalism progressed, this marketing evolved, and at a certain point (as <i>No Logo</i> by Naomi Klein points out) the product ceased to matter. A brand name represented not so much the product itself — sneakers, clothing, perfume, and now, democratic society — but the lifestyle pushed by the company whose logo decorated the product’s exterior. Nike, Gap, Calvin Klein, and now, America — a brand ready for export.</p>\n<p>Today no one is sufficiently outraged when images of radical icons are licensed to pimp products (postmortem): think Dr. Martin Luther King for Alcatel and Cingular; William S. Burroughs for Nike. No one gets upset when the environmental movement is effectively stifled by the co-opting of environmentalism as a marketing sales point; when former outlets for the expression of anger by marginalized groups are turned into revenue streams; when “Revolution” by the Beatles is heard in a Nike ad; when AIDSand breast cancer are used as marketing ploys.</p>\n<p>And so it follows that no one in the West is fazed by the simplistic notion that a country as incredibly complex as Lebanon, with its millennia of history, should be reduced to its people’s religious differences. Present-day America lives vicariously through the democratic movements of other countries and a projected sense of universal wellbeing that is ever harder to find at home. For just one example, the falling Berlin Wall became the backdrop for the false concept that all ideals of democracy emanate from the U.S., and, furthermore, that advertising is a proper venue for the dissemination of this ideal.</p>\n<p>Now, the concept of a “revolution” beneficial to Lebanon is ignored unless it can be used as a feel-good device for Western democracies to perceive themselves as having played a part in the country’s “independence” which, in fact, goes back half a century; the inaction of these countries this past summer paints a completely different picture in terms of their intentions. Whereas here in Lebanon the battle is still being played out (literally and figuratively), the bigger picture is much more serious — and horrifyingly more disastrous — for those of us living on the periphery of global capital’s various expansionist projects.</p>\n<p><b>Countering the Lie</b></p>\n<p>This empty brand identity, the Lie, is betrayed when a demonstration (seen as pro-U.S.) is painted as a “Cedar Revolution,” while the more recent, broader-reaching demonstrations are called “a pro-Syrian/Iranian threat” and an attempted “coup d’etat.” As stated by economist Samir Amin in the book <i>Obsolescent Capitalism</i>, the only political Islamic groups in this region targeted by American opprobrium — Hezbollah and Hamas — just happen to be those that are anti-imperialist in nature; they also happen to be democratically elected. In his article “Mid-point in the Middle East?” Tariq Ali concurs: “Western enthusiasm for rainbow revolutions stops, as is to be expected, when the color is green.” Similarly, South American countries, overturning the pro-imperialist governments that replaced their former democracies, are perceived as “threats” to this new world order, when in fact they only threaten the given economic status quo. Why aren’t their “democratic revolutions” celebrated and advertised?</p>\n<p>The Lie, as marketed by Leo Burnett (et. al.), goes back to Woodrow Wilson, who, when the Ottoman Empire was carved up among the post-War imperial powers, stated in his Twelfth Point: “… the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development.” Security of life — sounds catchy. But we didn’t get it then, and despite the current ad-based efforts to convince us of the contrary, we don’t see it on our horizon now. Furthermore, when foreign policy goals of globalizing entities in the region explicitly state their desire to continue to “carve up” Arab countries into more manageable ethnic or religious cantons, these calls to difference hidden behind anti-sectarian messages can be seen to be even more loaded, as well as more lethal.</p>\n<p>In response to the advertisers, designers and cultural sign-makers selling “Democracy,” opponents have spoken back by sending up the original ads themselves, thus forcing an uninvited dialogue. In Dahiyeh, those Arabic posters stating “We want to live” now include (in simulated spraypaint) “… in tents” (referring to the ongoing protest downtown); and “I love life” is now followed by “in colors” (referring to the multi-colored representative rainbow of all of Lebanon’s political parties).</p>\n<p>Some intrepid activists have added their own messages to the mix, such as “I [heart]<i>Aishti</i>” (both a reference to the local chain fashion outlet and <i>aish</i>, the Arabic root for “to live”) and “I [heart] Capitalism” [see Figs. 10, 11]. When those who craft the ad campaigns circulate jpegs of the opposition posters [see Fig. 9] with copy that reads “We want to live … in tents” and labeled “They hate life,” we begin to see the vested and invested interest(s) in these message battles. Quoting Samir Amin once again:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ideological discourse designed to rally public opinion in the central Triad [the United States, Japan and Europe] has been revamped to focus on a ‘duty to intervene’ in the name of ‘democracy,’ ‘national rights’ or ‘humanitarian considerations.’ But whereas the cynical instrumentalization and double standards involved in this discourse seem evident to people in Asia or Africa, Western public opinion has fallen in with it as enthusiastically as it did with the discourses of earlier phases of imperialism.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The visual creators and designers of this “ideological discourse” of ad campaigns currently running in Lebanon today should consider the ethical ramifications of their efforts, which focus on the purely reductive surface level and are representative of an unproven, and therefore unknowable, base ideology (although we can theorize about what is driving it); compared to, say, a political group with a stated political agenda. The fabricators of the larger discourse behind the ads should know that their message, and their media, are seen for what they are: shills for snake oil.</p>\n<p>The bleak cynicism of message makers and the powers they serve — simultaneously blaming the Lebanese for sectarianism while playing to the segregationist, if not “anti-other,” sentiments of a subsection of the Lebanese population; claiming one revolution while condemning any other; placing economic blame on the current opposition movement while fronting an economic reality that will plunder the country; harping on the concept of Lebanon as a unified nation while fomenting discord that would render the nation asunder; working for the destroyers of Lebanon as well as “for” the destroyed — approaches something deeply and darkly Orwellian, especially when using words such as “love” and “life.” There is a huge difference between wanting to live at the expense of others and wanting to live a dignified existence. In light of events this past summer, it can be stated that the current influx of cash to pro-American NGOs, state militias and advertising campaigns is just a continuation of the aggression recently suffered by Lebanon.</p>\n<p>Paul Rand stated: “Design … is also an instrument of disorder and confusion. Design for deception is often more persuasive than design for good; seduction is one of its many masks.” Those pushing the current discourse in Lebanon should not be surprised that it should thus be unmasked; that much of the world outside of their frame of reference is no longer buying their line, their lie, or their lifestyle; and that the Revolution, when it comes, will not be to their liking.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Drennan, originally from Beirut, returned to Lebanon eight years ago, worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Architecture and Design at the American University of Beirut, and is currently the Graphic Design Department coordinator at the American University of Science and Technology.

Second, they can easily be identified since they all have an SSID (network name) following this pattern “BlinkXXXXXX” where XXXXXX is a 6 character code, and this isn’t just any random code as it is derived from the router’s serial number. Unfortunately, the same applies to the WiFi password, it isn’t generated randomly but rather derived from the router’s serial number as well.</p>\n<p>Logically speaking, if you encounter a Blink network and were able to reverse the operation in a way that lets you guess the router’s serial number from the 6 character code in the SSID, retrieving the password would then be a piece of cake since it can be derived from this serial. That’s basically what some people have been doing for a while now since several tools are already available online allowing you enter the 6 character code once you stumble across a Blink network, and gives you the password in a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Up until lately, I was thinking the usage of these tools was somehow minimal and limited to techies since you will rarely find them on Lebanese website, until I lately came across this new Android application called “<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hack.blink\">Hack Blink</a>” with a download count of over 10,000 and rapidly increasing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.plus961.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hack-blink.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[6438]\"><img alt=\"hack blink\" src=\"http://www.plus961.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hack-blink-179x300.jpg\" width=\"179\" height=\"300\"></a></p>\n<p>Using the application is very straight forward, you enter the code and wait for the password, I tried it and it does work. So if you have a blink subscription, be sure someone around you will soon or later have this application and eventually start consuming your bandwidth.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there is a way to stop people from doing that by reconfiguring your router using <a href=\"http://www.ogero.gov.lb/admin/BillDetails/DSL/ThomsonModemSecurityGuide.pdf\">this manual</a> I found on Ogero’s website (which applies to Thomson routers). I strongly recommend you use that manual to change your SSID and setting the encryption algorithm to WPA2, in addition to of course changing the default wireless password. If you encounter any difficulty, make sure to either contact their customer support or just head to the nearest Ogero office in order for some support person to help you do it.</p>\n<p>Best solution is definitely for Ogero to stop ordering their routers to be configured this way!</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zuz\">@ZuZ</a> for the information he previously provided in <a href=\"http://lebgeeks.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=8524\">this post</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/AbirGhattas\">@AbirGhattas</a> just informed me “Hack Blink” was removed from the Play Store.

You first see your mother through your eyes. You first hear her voice through your ears. You first feel her touch through your skin, smell her hair through you nose and taste the food you are given through your taste buds.</p>\n<p>These sensory experiences help shape your brain dramatically – they alter your cognition and your interaction with the world around you in ways that you can’t even quantify.</p>\n<p>Now imagine you lost one of the organs responsible for your senses. Imagine you lost one of your eyes due to some freak accident. Imagine you were born with a genetic condition of deficient bone conduction in your ear or very few sensory cells in your nose to smell. Imagine for a second that your interaction with the world today is lacking one major aspect and you’ll see how hard it is. You only need to close one eye while walking with a few friends in order to see how your visual field is reduced.</p>\n<p>I have had one uncle who lost his eye as a child to a heater-related accident. My uncle has passed away now, may he rest in peace, but the loss of his eye was a life changing experience that, regardless of the psychological aspect of the matter, affected his life negatively. My best friend suffers from the same thing: he lost his eye because he was a playful little boy with a heightened sense of curiosity. My cousin has deficiency in his hearing and is helped with hearing aids that don’t give him the proper sense of hearing that you and I have but a sense that allows him to make do and lead a normal life – or as normal a life as you could lead.</p>\n<p>Lebanon is a country of war. We have all gone through very horrible life circumstances that have left many in Lebanon impaired. Some have had lasting damage to their spinal cord, leaving them crippled. Others have had their limbs completely amputated. The image is one that’s very hard to imagine.</p>\n<p>The above premise leads me to the following:</p>\n<p><strong>My idea:</strong></p>\n<p>What if I could give my best friend an eye that allows him to see the world the way I see it, that allows him to see people who walk on the side of his non-functional eye? What if I could give my cousin a cochlea that not only gets him to hear but gives him a perfect sense of hearing? What if we can give all the war injured people prosthetic limbs that do not only serve minimal function but can emulate the function of the limb they lost?</p>\n<p>Let’s take it a step further: what if we can extend the average life span, better life circumstances and improve the human condition?</p>\n<p>As a medical student, I am faced daily with countless diseases, even those with a genetic basis, whose only “purpose” is to lead to this organ failing or that. My job is to cut this path of destruction at a point which leaves the organ in question salvageable enough for me to give the patient a better quality of life. But what if I’m too late? And what if I can’t find a transplant organ in time?</p>\n<p>As things stand today, the only hope for my figurative patient is to die.</p>\n<p>All of these terminally-ill patients, impaired & blind & amputated people may have hope if we broaden our approach to our own body by employing the technological advances we have reached these days and create organs that combine this nano-technology that’s being pioneered around the world with the medical expertise that is available plenty.</p>\n<p>By creating a bionic eye, which combines medicine and technology which is helping shape medicine daily, someone who is blind might regain his sight. By integrating some minimal AI function on a prosthetic limb, an amputee might regain normal function in that limb.  By manufacturing a heart, the countless people around the Earth who suffer from cardiac conditions could find a way to become better.</p>\n<p>The list goes on. Imagine the possibilities if whichever organ comes to your mind is no longer a piece of fiction but a certainty that requires tinkering an approach and incorporating different disciplines together. The paths of the sciences are not as divided as people make them out to be. They are intertwined in more ways than they differ.</p>\n<p>The lifespan of these bionic organs would also be superior to the span of normal organs. Their availability means that any case of dysfunction can be fixed by pinpointing the circuit that’s leading to the shortage.</p>\n<p>What could we as Lebanese do? We have the minds and the medical expertise that could help shape this. And we have a lot of Lebanese youth whose pride and joy is technology – not just those who admire their smartphones but those who can actually build a smartphone or repair one in a matter of minutes. What those people need and currently lack is resources.</p>\n<p>You might say that such a plan is perhaps too far-fetched or too ambitious given where we are today. And perhaps it is. But going beyond the limitation of this body that we have might prove to be a key-point in bettering our life in so many other ways. These bionic organs can help us understand what we don’t currently understand about current bodily functions, notably neural, which we are currently ignorant about. The purpose of these organs might even surpass their imminent use and lead to a different approach to life in which people begin to tackle to problems that everyone faces in a more meaningful way, be it from pollution, to energy.</p>\n<p>My opinion is that this is the next frontier that medicine will be embarking on. If we, as Lebanese of the newer generation, embark on it, we might be able to catch up to the entire world in so many ways.

The deadline gave us only a few days, and I haven’t done nearly half of the research I would’ve like to to prepare a proper proposal. One reason is because there are <em>so many</em> things wrong with Lebanon, that I’d rather fix those up instead of thinking what we might excel at in the future thanks to smart folks and smart tech. Electricity, water, renewable energy, public transportation and that’s just the tip of the ice berg when it comes to things I would want to change. Next of course comes the current political system and the need to switch to a secular, transparent one where accountability is king, not the “za3im”.</p>\n<p>But, the competition asks us to let our imaginations go wild, and in this post, I am going to be selfish and plug in my personal dream and the farfetched possibility that I might one day realize it in my home country.</p>\n<p>I was lucky enough to study under some of Biology, Psychology and Neuroscience’s brightest minds today during my days at AUB. Learning under Dr. Arne Dietrich and briefly under Dr. Daniel Dennett made me abandon my pursuit of a medical career in hopes of dedicating my life to neuroscience and behavioral studies. While some guys might compare specs of cars and woot at a nice Ferrari, I get the hots for an fMRI machine or a chance to learn hands-on an EEG.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fmri-h2.gif\"><img alt=\"fmri.h2\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fmri-h2.gif?w=610&h=553\" width=\"610\" height=\"553\"></a><p>Sexy, huh?</p></div>\n<p>Of course, neuroscience is a tough subject today and the idea that we might <em>understand</em> ourselves scientifically, our consciousness, our decisions, even our <em>free will </em>is one few people are willing to accept. Regardless, it is a reality, and as Arne always used to say, “It’s like trying to drink out of a fire hydrant” and I personally feel neuroscience today cannot wait for society to keep up. While most of the world still thinks we use a small percentage of our brains, attributing genius like Einstein’s to him using “12% as opposed to our 10%” or other gibberish, neuroscientists have begun to <em>read </em>minds. Researchers have not only been able to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jan/31/mind-reading-program-brain-words\">predict images</a> from brain scans, but even <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-you-read-my-mind\">complex human thoughts</a> such as intentions.</p>\n<p>The 20th Century might have been Physics’ century, with nuclear power and space exploration reinventing our world, but the 21st Century is Biology’s where Genetics and Neuroscience will help us reinvent <em>ourselves</em>.</p>\n<h2>My Idea</h2>\n<p>Some of the ideas I considered was reviving <a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2012/10/02/the-lebanese-rocket-society-immortalizing-lebanons-superstar-scientists-on-the-silver-screen/\">Lebanon’s space age</a> and turning Lebanon into one of the world’s most prominent spaceports where satellites and other space-bound cargo would be shot up into orbit. Alas, our distance from the equator, lack of a sparsely-populated wide space as well as neighbors which probably won’t be too happy we have the capability of launching rockets into orbit, made me scrap this idea I had brainstormed on with my NASA-intern friend Alina. Plus, our industry is nowhere even close to building an automobile, how would we expect to catch up with the rest of the world when it comes to space crafts?</p>\n<p>My idea though, won’t need sophisticated industrial capabilities or billions of dollars in investments. It’ll need a fraction of the funds, a handful of dedicated scientists and maybe a dozen or so brain scanning machines of different types.</p>\n<p>The brain is the most complex thing in the entire known universe and the possibilities and permutations between all our neurons makes this electrified pile of goo we carry around in our skulls one of the “final frontiers” in science. By final frontier of course I mean the most exciting, and least explored, as in science, there is no final, no absolutes. Imagine approximately 100 billion neurons, each capable of up to 100,000 connections with other neurons… The possibilities are unfathomable, and mapping them out might seem like a daunting task. But, so was genetically engineering antibiotics in bacteria, and look where we are in that field today.</p>\n<p>My proposal is to set up a neuroscience research facility with the sole purpose of understanding human behavior. We would of course focus on what we regard as abnormal or undesirable, such as tell-tale signs of violence, sadism, racism, sectarianism, etc. How to discover it early on and attempt to rectify it or manage it with proper treatment if the brain’s vast plasticity allows us to.</p>\n<p>But, we could go so much further that trying to determine risk factors for adult misbehavior and criminal tendencies. How many of us feel they chose the wrong major? The wrong career? The wrong spouse? The wrong car? Etc. How can someone with very low empathy and ability to “put him/herself in other people’s shoes” become a successful psychologist? How can someone with poor visuospatial abilities become an accomplished industrial engineer? How can a man prone to impulsive, hair-trigger reactions be trusted to command a nation’s army? How can a police officer with a crippling sectarian and racist mindset safely patrol our streets? The list goes on and on…</p>\n<p>What if you could take a sneak-peak into the brain of a person, and highlight his or her weaknesses and strengths? What is orientation programs at school and job fairs at university were more than boring presentations and poorly printed leaflets and stress balls and pens? What if they were a few hours at an fMRI machine that would help steer you towards a scientific or more artistic future depending on what your brain is like. What if we could make sure inmates up for parole really are rehabilitated, and that their tendencies towards violence or rape for example, have truly been treated or at least safely manageable?</p>\n<p>Now, I’m sure your moral and ethical alarms’ sirens are blazing. This is massive. The idea that it could lead us to “pre-determine” who the bad guys will be, or gain the upper-hand on a rival, shakes the very foundations of our way of life. I think a Tom Cruise-style Minority Report is way out of our league right now, and that’s probably the wrong way to think about it. We might be born with the tendency to be violent, to rape, to delight in the pain and misery of others. But, if we are raised in a nurturing environment and have a generally good “nurture” part, the “nature” part might be kept in check. It’s always nature <em>and </em>nurture, never <em>or.</em> So I think that should allay the fears of ethics committees everywhere that this is a breach of the only private thing in this world: our subconscious mind. Folks should <em>never</em> be put in jail or condemned for a “most probably would have”, that’s just not right by us as humans to punish someone based on speculation only that may or may not come true depending on many, many other circumstances.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fmri_groot.jpg\"><img alt=\"fmri_groot\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fmri_groot.jpg?w=610\"></a>Lebanon can excel here because we have the biologists and psychologists that will design the experiments and translate the data, we have the engineers that will improve and maximize our imaging techniques and machines, we have the statisticians and mathematicians that will work out the algorithms we use to form a general idea, we have the capital necessary to set up this lab and most importantly, we have an intense need to better understand abnormal behavior and hopefully fix it.</p>\n<p>Who knows, maybe our research can determine why Lebanese people never stand in line. Maybe our research can determine why every time we’re out clubbing, someone has to get into a macho fist fight. Maybe our research can determine why cab drivers embody the thing we all hate most while driving. Maybe our research will find out why we keep voting for the exact, same, diseased members of parliament our parents did. Maybe our research will find out what the infamously undefinable “Lebanese identity” really is. But, most importantly, our research might help humanity as a whole better understand human behavior, how to properly deal with it, develop it and hopefully improve it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Neuroscience is an extremely fascinating and important branch of science today. It is evolving at the speed of a synaptic transmission, and that’s pretty damn fast. Lebanon can be at the forefront of that, an equal partner with the US and Europe and everyone else working on mapping and understanding our brain. Why should I have to move to the UK or the US for good to be able to realize my dream and the dream of so many of my friends and classmates? Let’s put Lebanon on the map for more than just big plates of food and grottos, let’s make it a place for great minds from across the world to come together and do one thing: study minds and make the world a better place.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This is my entry for the competition “<a href=\"http://www.reinventingtheworld.net/\">Lebanese Bloggers Reinvent The World</a>” competition run by the Lebanese Telecom Ministry for a chance to go to Silicon Valley with the minister of telecom.</em></p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12286/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12286/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12286&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

There’s no guarantee that the reports are authentic or accurate, but while looking for his name online, I found his mention in a <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Business/BusinessFeatures/Article.aspx?id=93818\">2008 article</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Poor Lebanon” is a much-loved preface to a litany of the country’s troubles. Parliament has been deadlocked for a year. A quarter of cabinet ministers are boycotting meetings. There’s been no president since November because quarreling lawmakers keep postponing a session to elect a replacement. In Beirut so far this year, 17 people have been killed and dozens wounded in car bombs, army gunfire on protesters and clashes between pro- and antigovernment groups. In south Lebanon, many fear new battles could erupt with Israel. It sounds like a disaster about to happen in a nation where a renewal of the devastating 1970s-’80s civil war is a chronic worry. <strong>But Amer Hazime doesn’t see it that way. While not exactly optimistic about the future, the young businessman – a Lebanese-Jordanian dual national – is shopping for an apartment in Beirut where he can live with his wife and daughter. “The security situation is deteriorating, the political situation is bad but I am looking to buy a flat. My wife is Lebanese and I want to live here,” Hazime said as he ate pizza one night at a crowded Italian restaurant in Beirut.<br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are many like Hazime.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>If the accusations are correct, I truly hope then that there’s only one Hazime. </p>\n<blockquote><p>On Feb 21, 2013, news got out in Lebanon that Amer Hazime, a well-known and rich business man living in Beirut has stolen millions of dollars from his friends and acquaintances, then ran away to Jordan or Europe (last seen in Paris, France)</p>\n<p>He has stolen the money under the pretense that he is investing it in gold and stocks. He made a lot of money when gold prices were very high, but then continued to take money and invest it even though he was losing on ever transaction.</p>\n<p>The reason why people trusted him is because he was always seen in expensive cars, living in expensive homes (last residence: Platinum Building in Downtown Beirut) and wearing expensive watches. His unsuspecting victims saw that he was making a huge profit and starting throwing their money at him without any legal contract / documentation.</p>\n<p>If you are a victim of Amer Hazime, then please speak out and file a law suite so that justice can be served. Respond to the rip off report and make yourself heard. He is a home-wrecker and ruined the lives and reputations of everyone around him (including his family, who have fled Lebanon to Jordan)</p>\n<p>If you ever come into contact with this person, do not trust him because he is a con artist. He goes around pretending that he is a pious Muslim, but in fact he is no such thing! If he were a real Muslim he would not be gambling and stealing!

Overall, there were about 25 looks,including a few menswear outfits. The collection’s palette consisted mainly of black and whites with a lot of pink nude in addition to a couple of red looks. The collection was very high street-H&M but taken to a whole new level with the quality of the fabrics used, the details in the beading, the fur and the feathers.It was definitely a collection I’ll be shopping especially a pair of black pants with gold beading, a pink nude faux-fur jacket, a gorgeous embroidered black blazer, their black knee-high leather boots and a couple of long and minimalistic black dresses. </span><br><span> Discover the pictures below!<br><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HM1.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"HM1\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HM1-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"HM1 1024x731 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"416\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0158.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"DSC_0158\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0158-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 0158 680x1024 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"879\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0159.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"DSC_0159\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0159-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 0159 680x1024 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"879\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0792.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"IMG_0792\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0792-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0792 768x1024 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"778\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HM2.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"HM2\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HM2-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"HM2 1024x731 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"416\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0142.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"DSC_0142\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0142-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 0142 680x1024 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"879\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0152.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"DSC_0152\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0152-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 0152 680x1024 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"879\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HM2.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><br></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HM3.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"HM3\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HM3-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"HM3 1024x682 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"388\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0129.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"DSC_0129\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0129-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 0129 680x1024 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"879\"></a><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0135.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10042]\"><img title=\"DSC_0135\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0135-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 0135 680x1024 Around the world: H&M Autumn/Winter 2013   Paris Fashion Week\" width=\"584\" height=\"879\"></a>At the after-party, the attendees enjoyed the flowing bubbly as well as feel-good tunes spun by the dj! Any thoughts on this collection and this new step for H&M? </span><br><span> Fashionably yours,</span><br><span> Lana xx</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.larmoiredelana.com/?p=10042\" title=\"Share on Facebook\">Share on Facebook</a></p>'),

If you haven’t participated yet you still have tonight to do so for a chance to win a trip to Silicon Valley with the Minister. Visit this <a href=\"http://www.reinventingtheworld.net/\">link</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Since I support anything that encourages blogging, here is my submission:</p>\n<p><b>Screens that speak to your senses and bio-internet</b></p>\n<p>There are moments when you close your eyes and travel to a different reality just to disconnect from the harsh truth allowing your brain to go euphoric over ideas that may or may not materialize one day. That’s a quick and easy way to relief stress; at least for me.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to state the obvious by talking about how the internet has revolutionized everything, nor about how I believe that e-commerce could save struggling economies nor how I find the concept of countries ridiculous and how people should be able to move freely and benefit from an equally developed infrastructure everywhere. No. I’m going to tell you about something that I have been thinking about that could help boost e-commerce even further and how we could use internet differently.</p>\n<p>Screens. Yes, screens… but not any kind of screens, not the regular “touch” screen. I’m talking about screens with a surface that could render sensorial and olfactory information as well. Until today, screens were able to speak to the eyes and ears…what about smell, touch and taste? Decisions regarding a lot of groceries, new foods, perfume, textile etc. would become easier. The screen would render the chemical information in a way one would apply to the tongue or smell; just enough to pass it on to the brain. On a medical level this could help a lot of patients who suffer from certain disorders. The screen would also render the feel of an object as well. From an educational perspective a class would be able to touch and feel sculptures, ancient pottery and other art to understand why they were important to a certain civilization during a period of time.</p>\n<p>Shall I get crazier? What about a thought to digital information converter that would be connected to an on-the-move technology. Our senses already grab data that is conserved somewhere since we can remember and translate in different ways, right? Why wouldn’t I be able to share that data with someone in a distant country just by a mental order or even talk to people via the same technology? Imagine how learning could become easier: university would “upload” knowledge for students to “download, they’d be able to know a lot of additional things in less time and would have more time to engage into practical activities…</p>\n<p>Now what if our skin could do photosynthesis like plants; no one would die of starvation nor have any kind of disease related to food nor need any of the foods that we currently have. That would cancel the whole economy based on this basic need allowing us to shift efforts to other things and…</p>\n<p>OK, OK, let’s calm down, I could go on for days.</p>\n<p>I’m glad that there are no laws when it comes to dreaming and thinking. The world will always be a better place in my mind.</p>\n<p><a></a><a></a><a></a><a href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fritakml.info%2F2013%2F02%2F28%2Flebanese-bloggers-reinvent-the-world%2F&title=Lebanese%20Bloggers%20Reinvent%20the%20World\"><img src=\"http://ritakml.info/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_120_16.png\" width=\"120\" height=\"16\" alt=\"share save 120 16 Lebanese Bloggers Reinvent the World\" title=\"share save 120 16 photo\"></a></p><p>The post <a href=\"http://ritakml.info/2013/02/28/lebanese-bloggers-reinvent-the-world/\">Lebanese Bloggers Reinvent the World</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://ritakml.info/\">ritakml.info</a>.</p>'),

They could provide you with a job, get you out of a tough spot, provide you with a decent future. The saying goes: behind every comfortable man in this country is a super “wasta” taking care of things.</p>\n<p>Some people’s wasta is so strong it gets them to evade jail time entirely for trading massive amounts of drugs, ruining the lives of countless people in the process. It’s fairly straightforward: <em>mne2leba ta3ate.</em> (we turn their drug trading to drug use). </p>\n<p>I will not mention acronyms or allude to names or people or political parties because the issue isn’t specific to one side of Lebanon’s political spectrum. </p>\n<p>But do you know those major drug scandals we hear about in the news?</p>\n<p>I know for a fact that those who are in charge of the whole affair never get reprimanded. All they get is a very, very minimal jail time that serves to “clean their system” while the bigger fish take care of all those extra loose ends that may have remained.</p>\n<p>If you want to trade drugs in Lebanon, make sure you know someone influential. That someone could be a parliament member, it could be an family with a full blown military wing, it could also be a major political party head. Because if you know such people, you will never get caught. And even if you get caught, the only thing you get is a slap on the wrist while someone else pinches your cheek.</p>\n<p><em>Good boy</em>, they’d say. <em>He turned his whole life around.</em> </p>\n<p>As for all those poor souls whose lives this good boy ruined, well, tough luck for them. They don’t know someone who can make jail time easier for them.</p>\n<p><em>Mne2leba lal tajra ta3ate</em>. Because breaking the law, ruining the lives of so many people and not facing repercussions for it is how things are done here. And they have the audacity to want to keep their shamelessness secret.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a> Tagged: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/drug-trade/\">drug trade</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/drug-use/\">drug use</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/drugs/\">drugs</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6812/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6812/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=6812&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

The charges varied from a life-time ban and a $15,000 penalty to 1 season ban and meager penalty of $2000. Having said that, I still believe the charges aren’t harsh enough and the damage that these players caused to the Lebanese Football is irreparable.</p>\n<p>Why am I saying that? Just check the match-fixing details as they happened that Al-Akhbar <a href=\"http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/178382\">published</a> yesterday! In fact I will make an effort and translate few excerpts into English to show you how bad this is.</p>\n<p>First story is from the game that opposed Lebanon to South Korea back in June 2012 and that Lebanon lost 3-0. While thousands of Lebanese in Lebanon and abroad were cheering for their team, supporting them in every way possible, making Lebanon trend on Twitter, coming up with new songs and video clips on YouTube and encouraging the players one by one, two of our National Team Players were conspiring to make us lose 4-0 to earn some extra cash from a bet they had placed earlier. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\nلقصص التي لم تنشر سابقاً كثيرة وبعضها يصيب المرء بالصدمة وبالقرف في آنٍ معاً، اذ لا يمكن تقبّل فكرة ان الجمهور اللبناني كان جالساً على اعصابه امام شاشات التلفزة لمتابعة المباراة التي خسرها لبنان امام كوريا الجنوبية 0-3 في حزيران الماضي، في الوقت الذي كان ينادي فيه لاعب مدافع على زميله المهاجم بعدم التقدّم الى الامام بهذا الشكل بل العودة الى الخلف للمشاركة في المهمة بحيث ان «التعليمة» تقول بأنه يفترض ان يخسر لبنان بنتيجة 0-4 والوقت كان قريباً من النهاية.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second Story is from the last Arab cup where Lebanon was facing Iraq. Lebanon’s best goalkeeper Abdel Samad was injured and due to miss the game but the coach allowed him to play at the last second. This last-minute change led 8 of the players/officials involved in match-fixing to try and convince Samad in the dressing room to concede 3 goals. Samad was enraged by their request and told them he’d never do such a thing. Iraq won by one goal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>والصمد نفسه عاش تجربة صادمة في كأس العرب الاخيرة، فهو عشية المباراة امام العراق أُبلغ بعدم خوضه للقاء قبل ان يبدّل المدرب الالماني ثيو بوكير رأيه ويعلمه باشراكه بدلاً من محمد حمود. هذا القرار خربط كل حسابات عملاء مكاتب المراهنات، فتوجّه ثمانية منهم الى الصمد خلال تبديله لملابسه طالبين منه المساهمة بخسارة لبنان بثلاثية نظيفة، فكان ردّ الحارس صارماً وقاسياً على محدثيه متوعداً اياهم بالاسوأ في حال كرروا طلبهم بخصوص موضوعٍ مشابه. وهذا الحديث جرى على مسامع اداري المنتخب فؤاد بلهوان الذي كان متواجداً بالصدفة في دورة المياه. ودورات المياه كانت مركزاً في بعض الاحيان لتوزيع الاموال، وفي احيانٍ اخرى باحات المطارات حيث سُدّدت المبالغ – المكافآت للمتورّطين.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I never followed closely Lebanese Football but never missed a chance to support the National Team, but after reading these stories, I don’t think I will ever watch any football game that includes Lebanese clubs or the National Team.</p>\n<p>Respect to Roda Antar, Youssef Mohammad, Bilal Najarian and Ziad el Samad and to all the players who refused to betray their team and stood against other players fixing games and placing bets.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3UgLNuX6a4A\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> [<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UgLNuX6a4A\">YouTube</a>]<br><em>I want to believe that the investigation was clean and thorough but I can’t</em></p>'),

A full description of the event is listed on the <a title=\"Social Media Week: Syrian Activists on Using Internet for the Revolution\" href=\"http://socialmediaweek.org/blog/event/syrian-activists-on-internet-advocacy/#.US5bGFojpsh\">Social Media Week website</a>, which provided the occasion for the event.</p>\n<p>During the hangout, most questions were directed to Osama, an activist and engineer from Idlib. Speaking in Arabic, he offered a detailed look at how social media was adopted in his region and the danger, excitement, and responsibility that it carried with it. He also mentioned different ways in which tools were used, to coordinate before protests, to communicate between civilian networks, and to appeal to international populations to influence their political leaders to do something to stop the violence.</p>\n<p>He recalled how at the beginning of the revolution, protestors often didn’t know what Facebook or Skype were and how people were learning from one another how to use the tools. “We were under a lot of pressure to do workshops and give people detailed instructions on how to use these services because there was a lot of ignorance about how to use these services. People never really had the need before,” he said. “But when people saw their protest on television . . . and made that connection, they realized how important YouTube is.”</p>\n<p>Kenan Rahmani, a Syrian-American activist, translated for Osama, and spoke about the importance of activists’ reporting during the revolution for getting the truth out of the country, especially when traditional journalists couldn’t get in and traditional media got it wrong. Activists like him and Osama, he said, could offer more context—not only “because we were talking to activists 24 hours a day,” he explained, but also because “if the information wasn’t verified by several independent sources of activists, we wouldn’t share it. We had guidelines as to what was verified and what was legitimate news and what wasn’t.”</p>\n<p>Whether acting as journalists or activists, questions came up several times during the conversation about the effect their actions had had on the international response to the crisis. Very little, in Osama’s opinion. “After two years of protest,” he said, “we did all this. We wanted just a little freedom, not even everything. And the international community didn’t do anything.”</p>\n<p>Still, even as the fall of Assad remains only an expectation rather than a fait accompli, Osama and others are looking forward to civilian rule. In fact, he’s already started a local civilian council. Asked whether there’s a role for social media in this new world, he said, Yes, that with the lack of reliable media, it’s the “only vehicle for their message.”</p>\n<p>In fact, already all the work of the civilian councils is being shared on social networks to establish their legitimacy and credibility and to prove that the civilian structures actually dominate the military ones. “The Free Syrian Army is actually subject to and serves the structures of our town,” he said.</p>'),

What’s this tension all about? Why the on-off exchange of fire?</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b> I said previously the war in Syria was taking an alarming turn and that Syria risked biting the dust. I warned of the war’s repercussions on Lebanon. I was trying then to avert a spillover and urging Lebanon’s Sunnis and Shiites to stand together and spare Lebanon the Syria war fallouts. I didn’t imagine we would choose – of our own volition -- to join the sedition in Syria.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b><i>Abboud:</i></b><i> Who is “we”?</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b> We Lebanese, both Sunnis and Shiites. We elected to join the sedition, which was a very dangerous thing to do. The result can only be catastrophic. I am certain: whoever is behind this does not give a hoot about the future of either the Sunnis or Shiites, or about Lebanon or the region. And here, I would like to interject a word to my meritorious, beloved, pious and righteous sons in Hezbollah…</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b><i>Abboud:</i></b><i> …Do your meritorious sons include the Hezbollah leadership?</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b> I include some of the leaders, yes. I remind the rest that each time some members, some Iranians, tried to put us off-course and have us fight wars here and there against this side or that, we refused and remained focused on Palestine… Today, to put it bluntly, we are fighting in Syria.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b><i>Abboud:</i></b><i> Who is fighting in Syria?</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b> Hezbollah.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b><i>Abboud:</i></b><i> Is Hezbollah fighting in Syria, or is it defending or helping Lebanese in villages there?</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b><span>  </span>It is fighting in Syria.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b><i>Abboud:</i></b><i> Those in Syria are defending themselves.</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b> I don’t want to hide behind my finger. The Shiites in Syria don’t need someone to defend them. We compromised them and we ensnared them. If they are in danger, we are to blame. We are responsible for any harm befalling any Shiite in Syria. We got them in trouble. We caused them pain. They didn’t need our help or our solidarity. Even today, we can still take the correct steps and desist. By so doing, Syria’s Shiites would be spared Syria’s tragedy.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b><i>Abboud:</i></b><i> But Hezbollah does not speak of Syria’s Shiites. It speaks of the Lebanese Shiites residing on Syrian territory.</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b> I am referring to both. Moreover, the stones of the shrine (in the Damascus suburbs) of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaynab_bint_Ali\">Sayyeda Zeinab</a> do not need our protection. All this is haywire and meant for the naïve. The real aim (of Hezbollah now) is to protect the regime – a tyrannical regime killing its own people. Is it conceivable to see the Syrian people being slaughtered and shelled by all sorts of weapons? Not once did Syria fire a missile – of the types being rained on Aleppo, among other places -- toward Palestine, not even in (the Israel-Hezbollah war of) 2006. To avoid saying it is defending the regime, Hezbollah invented all this rubbish about protecting Shiites, the Lebanese in Syria and the Sayyeda Zeinab shrine. Hezbollah is implicating Syria’s Shiites.</span></div><div><span>Hezbollah and Iran are accountable for every Shiite life lost in Syria. They are responsible for every house destroyed or tree cut in Syria. We could have spared the Shiites of Syria, Lebanon and the region this hateful sectarian conflict.</span></div><div><span>We claim to be followers of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_ibn_Ali\"><span>Imam Hussein</span></a> and his struggle against injustice. And what we have in Syria are people wanting to rid themselves of an unjust ruler. Our legal, religious, moral and humanitarian duty is to take the side of the oppressed Syrian people. Any other stance is a heinous crime for which we will be held accountable before God.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b><i>Abboud:</i></b><i> A viewer emailed this question, “Would a Hezbollah fighter killed in Syria be considered a martyr?”</i></span></div><div><span><b>Tufayli:</b> A martyr because he killed Muslim children, because he panicked them, a martyr because he destroyed their homes, a martyr because he is allegedly liberating Palestine?

In fact it is a testimony of his dynamism on a topic that I care deeply about that I keep writing these critical posts.</em></p>\n<p>Today I was browsing <a href=\"http://lebaneseblogs.com/\"><em>Lebanese Blogs</em></a> and I came across Rami’s <a href=\"http://www.plus961.com/2013/02/lebanese-bloggers-reinvent-the-world/\">post</a> about a <a href=\"http://www.reinventingtheworld.net/\">competition</a> called “Lebanese bloggers reinvent the world”, launched by Lebanon’s ministry of telecommunication. In a nutshell, bloggers are invited to write a post about a revolutionary idea that has the potential to change the world. The submitted posts would then be judged by a panel of prominent Lebanese people in Silicon Valley, and the winner gets to travel with Minister Sehnaoui to California.</p>\n<p>From a political perspective, this is a brilliant move: The Lebanese people will love it because it will remind them that there are successful Lebanese people in silicon valley. The media will love it because it’s a nice story with glitz and tech. Bloggers will love it because of the potential prize of travelling to the USA. The Lebanese venture capitalists in California will love it because it will make it seem like they’re looking for talent from all over the world.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately though, this competition is premised on a flawed understanding of the nature of innovation.</p>\n<h2>The deceptive appeal of big ideas</h2>\n<p>One of the known fairy tales in silicon valley is that a big idea can change the world. What reigns supreme in the San Francisco bay is not the sparkling flash of inspiration, but painstaking execution, iteration and traction. Many people had the idea of a social network in the past (friendster, hi5 and mySpace to name a few), but Mark Zukerberg was the one who properly executed on it and kept iterating (ie tweaking, adapting and adjusting) until Facebook became what it is today: A world-reinventing product.</p>\n<p>What silicon valley venture capitalists want to hear is not that you have a bright idea, but that you have a bright idea that works and has traction. Because let’s be honest, the world is full of people who think they have a big idea that can change the world. Also, “revolutionary” products are usually more about evolution than revolution, and the evolution often goes in unexpected directions. For example, the iPhone only existed because of the iPod, and when Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod many years ago, he didn’t think that it will eventually lead to a revolutionary touch interface mobile phone.</p>\n<h2>It’s all about an enabling environment</h2>\n<p>What really helps innovation is an environment like that in Silicon Valley, where people try many things and keep failing until something worthwhile comes up.</p>\n<p>This requires a cultural acceptance of failure as a necessary prerequisite to success, but it also requires a ton of infrastructure: Fast and cheap internet, good roads, 24-hour power, availability of cheap finance. All this will lead to people with big ideas to come and try their luck at building their dream and see where they can go.</p>\n<p>The biggest idea for reinventing Lebanon Mr. Sehnaoui (and eventually perhaps, the world), is better and cheaper infrastructure. Consider this my submission.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=Sguwp-uldT8:jQ7xjZurrc8:J3aVl1i_38o\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=J3aVl1i_38o\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/beirutspring/fb_feed/~4/Sguwp-uldT8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">'),

Check it out, you won’t be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I stepped outside and noticed a shop a few meters away with studded kicks, caps and skull speakers which reminded me of the places in the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. Fashion in Los Angeles is often thought of as the Hollywood Red Carpet-style haute couture by massive names and even more massive price tags. But, the average Los Angelino will probably be sporting a 50USD Diamond Supply Co tee with a smart-ass quote on it and a diamond insignia. I liked these independent shops because their stuff was often limited quantity for each tee, cap, etc. Which means you’re probably gonna be the only one wearing it when you’re out.</p>\n<p>If I could count how many identical Louis Vuitton clutches I see every weekend at White, I wouldn’t because I’d be busy enjoying my time doing something fun. But, you get the idea. Paying lotsa money to carry something everyone else is carrying isn’t always what I’m into. I like wearing stuff that I know no one else is gonna be wearing and I sure love seeing a woman in something that makes me think “nice” and not because it’s revealing, but because it’s different from the H&M stuff that it seems every woman on Earth goes to buy at the same exact time.</p>\n<p>Getting back to the store, I went in looking for some Diamond Supply Co. caps but soon enough I found out it was actually a French store, that had just opened the other day and was still finalizing their showroom. The name was hard to get at first, CLVII (it’s 157 in Roman numerals) which signifies the address of the Paris street the store originated on.</p>\n<p>After a very pleasant tour of the place with Zaynab, I got to actually meet the designer, Julien, who I had a chat with about his concept which I actually was interested in (a rarity when it comes to Fashion).</p>\n<p>Julien explained that the idea behind his brand was that even though it’s noticed and often by important people like Rihanna, Lil’Wayne and Jason De Rulo, he tries to keep a lid on it and relies mostly on word of mouth of his customers, who are often members of Gulf countries’ Royal Families doing a layover in Paris on their way to the States and stock up on customized, somewhat over-the-top couture from CLVII.</p>\n<p>Julien felt traditional brands were getting dull and boring, and that every piece of upscale fashion was the same. That’s why, he’d take people’s 5000USD bags, rip it up, poke holes in it and add elements to it that would “pimp it up”. So, now, his customers can have an LV clutch that’s slightly more noticeable.</p>\n<p>Of course, most of us can’t afford to blow 5K on a bag, but do wear G-shocks, converses, etc. And CLVII does that too. The out-of-the-way, sorta hushed-tone-feel of the place is embodied in CLVII Beirut too. The showroom looks kinda tiny, but, when you start getting interested and want more, the large mirror in the middle is actually a “hidden” door which is opened up and lets you into the much larger back rooms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/032912-music-jason-derulo-broken-neck1.jpg\"><img alt=\"032912-music-jason-derulo-broken-neck\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/032912-music-jason-derulo-broken-neck1.jpg?w=300&h=168\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\"></a>That’s where a wider selection of items, pieces of art and fitting happens. Now, price-wise, it could be up to 2000K to customize a women’s blazer with 24-karat gold studs. But, it could be a good-old Yankees cup with studs for much, much less. Personally, the thing that got me was that you could bring in your own stuff, and get them to customize it for you, and I do mean everything. Julien even studded Jason De Rulo’s neck brace with black diamonds…</p>\n<p>So, if you’re into the more funky, urban type of fashion, a fan of Kanye (yuck), Lil Wayne (meh), Rihanna (Yes please) or Wiz (HELL YES!) then you might enjoy this store. The guys and gals that run it are really nice and helpful, but not incessant in their flattery like “wow, yes, this looks great on you” just to make a sale. They’ll just say “no, that’s not it” or “this is way too expensive” if it doesn’t fit the budget you set for yourself and I loved that honesty in an often “7arboo2″ type of salesmanship in Beirut.</p>\n<p>It’s located in Saifi Village and here’s their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clviibeirut?ref=ts&fref=ts\">Facebook page</a>.</p>\n<p><a

The names have been altered – albeit they still retain a “Christian” flavor but I promise it’s not for Sectarian reasons – except my own.</p>\n<p><strong>Georges</strong>: You know, they said they might postpone the elections.</p>\n<p><strong>Mary:</strong> Better. Nothing good can come out of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> Makes sense seeing as we don’t have a law yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> There is one. The Orthodox Law.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> What about the Orthodox Law?</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> It’s supposed to make our votes weightier. How the hell does Hariri get a parliament member in Achrafieh and the LF don’t? Or how can’t the LF choose MPs across Lebanon like Aoun does without Hariri hoarding their backs?</p>\n<p><strong>Georges</strong>: Yes. And those imbeciles with the Future Movement have the decency to call us unpatriotic. As if they are the patriotic ones for not supporting the Orthodox law only because their man Hariri doesn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Yeah and they’ve always been in bed with the Syrians screwing us. They’re ones to talk about patriotism. Their leader got blown up? Have we had a leader who hasn’t been threatened in this country?</p>\n<p><strong>Georges:</strong> Hariri doesn’t even have the decency to stand up against Al Assir. And he has the nerves to call on the LF for trying to distance themselves from his sinking ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph</strong>: He doesn’t even have the money anymore. Looks like Saudi Arabia may not be in with him on this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Georges</strong>: Saudi Arabia is busy drawing caricatures about the patriarch while they go fuck Christians every day. What a country of retards. Fuck them and their prophet.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> Enough with religious crap. How would you feel if someone insulted your Christ?</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph</strong>: Whatever. Anyway, I’m with the Orthodox Law. It allows us to stick it to Aoun.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie</strong>: There are other laws which do that and allow the LF to have more weight without being this crappy. Besides, why would you want to vote for the MP of Keserwan or anywhere else exactly? <em>Betdallak ghrib. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Georges</strong>: How does the Orthodox Law work exactly? We vote for the Maronites of Batroun only?</p>\n<p><strong>Mary:</strong> I don’t understand why you must have this discussion every week. Is it gonna be this way until election day?</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> You go into the voting place. The person in charge gives you a ballot paper with all the lists running for your sect’s MPs. You choose one of the lists then you pick an MP to give him or her your preferential vote. So we vote for the Maronites of Lebanon. All 34 of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> How will I explain this process to my mother exactly? I’m not sure if I understand it.</p>\n<p><strong>Mary:</strong> the more complex these laws become, the more I think all these elections are useless. The same people are gonna win any way.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> I know how I’m voting.</p>\n<p><strong>Georges:</strong> Yeah, me too.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> If the law stays the same and we remain a one district place, I’m most probably not voting for Antoine Zahra. I’m sure as hell not voting for Boutros Harb and definitely not for Gebran Bassil.</p>\n<p><strong>Georges</strong>: Are you fucking serious? Please tell me you’re joking.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie</strong>: Not at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph</strong>: Leave him be. He’ll change his mind soon. Elie not voting for Antoine Zahra? And pigs fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie</strong>: Why would I vote for Antoine Zahra exactly? What has he done that should make me eternally grateful for him that he should get my vote and stay and MP for the 3rd time?</p>\n<p><strong>Georges:</strong> He’s not Gebran Bassil!</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> I’m not voting for Gebran Bassil.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph</strong>: Not voting for Zahra is you not caring enough. If other people thought like you, Bassil would win.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Why would anyone give a shit? My family has been supportive of Boutros Harb ever since he entered parliament in 1972. And what good did that do us? I never asked anything of him. Never. Except when I wanted to provide my son who studied law with a job. I begged him and he promised he’d help but he didn’t. I held it in and I voted for him in 2009 because I couldn’t stand the idea of Bassil winning. I was happy when Harb won because Bassil didn’t win. But my son is now working a dead-end job with no prospects. I would never admit this to a Aounist of course. Screw them.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie</strong>: I understand but an MP’s job isn’t exactly to provide jobs for those who ask for it. He should have helped. But what has he done in the past 23 years that should get me to vote for him? Nothing!</p>\n<p><strong>Georges:</strong> the highway!</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph</strong>: Yes, the highway.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> the highway that has been in the works for 40 years? The one which was started near Tannourine because that makes perfect sense? No, thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>Georges:</strong> As long as there’s something called Michel Aoun roaming the Earth, I will vote against him.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> What about the economy? The roads? Electricity? Telecom?</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Oh shut up. You’re almost becoming Aounist these days with liking Sehanoui. Do you fancy that unibrow?</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> The man does a good job. I cannot not acknowledge it. Besides, why would you not care about the economy and security in voting? Do you fancy almost every one my age leaving the country or considering leaving it?</p>\n<p><strong>Georges:</strong> Really? Assume I won’t be voting for the LF because you don’t like them these days. <em>Mesh 3ejebne bel marra 3a fekra</em>. Who am I supposed to vote for? Those third party leftists who have no chance of winning?</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> I don’t know. But voting for someone because you want the other to lose doesn’t work for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph</strong>: It does for me. As long as Gebran Bassil never ever becomes a parliament member, I’m happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Georges: </strong>I concur. I couldn’t have been happier when he lost in 2009.</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> Gebran Bassil isn’t winning in Batroun no matter how I vote. At least I’d rather vote in a way that doesn’t make me feel disgusted with myself for the years afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> What if he wins?</p>\n<p><strong>Elie:</strong> Really? How is that possible exactly? Where will he get his votes? Do you want me to get you the 2009 results for you to see how impossible that is? Let’s not pretend that a lot of people in the district are thinking like me at the moment. <em>Kellna 3ashra</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Georges:</strong> Yeah, 10 is more than enough of your kind for now. We can’t let them win and run the country. We can’t allow it. Michel Aoun wants to get that Orthodox Law to pass so he becomes president next year, you know that?</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Yes, that’s true. He wants to become president.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Michel Aoun president? Hell no. If that law passes, I’m voting for the LF without blinking. I can’t allow it!</p>\n<p>I expect this discussion or some variants of it to be taking place every Sunday when the family is gathered for lunch or any other festivity for that matter until elections are over. I’m sure that the same discussion is taking place in other households which are different from mine politically in more or less the same way. Everyone is talking elections these days. So why not make what people say behind closed doors public? It beats beating around the bush in pretending as if things will change.</p>\n<p>I only had to see a pollster in action in my hometown to see exactly how few things have really changed and how much the circumstances had.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/elections-2013/\">Elections 2013</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a> Tagged: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/antoine-zahra/\">Antoine Zahra</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/aoun/\">Aoun</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/batroun/\">Batroun</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/elections/\">Elections</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/fpm/\">FPM</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/gebran-bassil/\">Gebran Bassil</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lf/\">LF</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/religion/\">Religion</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6802/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6802/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=6802&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

These are the result of a series of surgeries I underwent between the ages of 16 and 18 as a result of my lungs collapsing. Towards the end of my teenager years, I was ashamed of them, refusing to take my shirt off in public. The biggest scar runs right across my heart. I’m sure there’s something to be said about that, but I don’t know what.</p>\n<p>My 4 tattoos. The first, a dancing man by Keith Haring, was inked after I finished my first world tour. My second, a symbol for hope, was done right after getting my BA. The third, which reads “Who am I being that my children’s eyes are not shining?”, I got during my second world tour, following a series of inspiring events in my life. The last one, “this too shall pass”, signifies a new, more mature(?) approach to life.</p>\n<p>My posture. As a child, my uncle used to always tell me that men who respect themselves stand up straight. He also used to tell me that if he were as tall as I am, he would be proud to show it off. I do not stand up straight, hard as I try.</p>\n<p>Strange body hair patterns, the result of having been shaved (from top to bottom) for surgery at 16, 17, and 18. I hate my body hair patterns.</p>\n<p>My belly, that will forever make me feel like I am not good enough, sexy enough, fit enough, interesting enough. I grew up (very) skinny, and only started gaining weight when I turned 25. As a child, I used to be convinced that I was adopted, only because I was the only (very) skinny one in my family. Having a belly is strange for me, even though I am fully aware that I am not fat. I have only had to deal with weight issues in my thirties.</p>\n<p>My eyes, tiny, unable to see colors, and that can barely see anything without glasses.</p>\n<p>My nose, a typical Arab man’s nose, that has been the only thing making plastic surgery tempting for me. When I was younger, living in Los Angeles, surrounded by white people with small noses, made me very self-conscious about my nose. Today, back in Beirut, I don’t think it’s that big anymore.</p>\n<p>My balding head. I figured out I was going to be bald when I was young. My father, all 4 of my uncles, and both grandfathers were bald. It’s still not easy to digest.</p>\n<p>My broken front tooth, the result of a very serious bicycle accident when I was younger. My brother had tricked me down a hill that was too steep for my age, teaching me that the best way to stop was to only use the front brakes.</p>\n<p>A series of scars: on my left nostril from a ski accident, on the back of my neck from a cyst that needed to be removed, on my head as a result of an altercation with a cousin, on my elbows and knees from the bicycle accident that broke my tooth, next to my left eye from something I don’t remember.</p>\n<p>My insecurity. You can see it in the way I stand, in the way I avoid your gaze, in the way I suck in my stomach, in the way I try to hide my imperfections. It is the thing that holds me back the most, the thing that gets in the way of my happiness. It is the thing I hate the most about myself. It destroys my self-esteem and my well-being.</p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ohmyhappiness.wordpress.com/386/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ohmyhappiness.wordpress.com/386/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ohmyhappiness.com&blog=31607285&post=386&subd=ohmyhappiness&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

Even though everyone had told me to expect that, I still find that overwhelming. When I drive up the mountain in the evening and look back at the sunset, it’s just extraordinary. But then also, as we discussed, the complexity of Lebanon, and the fact that on the surface so much is logical and yet beneath the surface it becomes much, much more complicated. So I’m very daunted by the scale of the challenge in trying to understand how politics and society works. I think, most of all, [I’m struck] by the energy and the dynamism of life here and of people here. You know, the talent of the people I am working with at the embassy, who actually are more talented I think than any group of staff I have worked with in much bigger embassies, but also then the talent of the people you meet around the circuit, it’s just overwhelming how many incredibly well-educated people you come across, who have a point of view on everything, very articulate, often in a third language. That is extraordinary. I think that encourages me that this is somewhere where, as an ambassador, you can actually have an impact because people want to talk and people are receptive and people are engaging. It’s not a country where an ambassador is just writing reports for his capital and going to diplomatic receptions. Here you are actually part of the game.</p></blockquote>'),

We shall see where this goes, if there is interest in the public interest.</p>\n<p>There is a lot still to examine in the piece, but I remember now how much I enjoyed the idea that Filkins seems to suggest his “Dany” gave him the fake name in order to protect his identity <em>from Hezbollah.</em> The implication was Dexter really hit pay dirt with his source who was telling him things <em>“no one was permitted to discuss”</em> – in Dexter’s sweeping words. This is real Pulitzer territory, that Dexter, newly arrived from a short stint in Iraq and New Dehli bureau chief, could score such a big truthtelling few days tour (although McClatchy the next day has their Dani saying virtually the same damaging things about their own party).</p>\n<p>A few more strands -</p>\n<p>– Dexter says confidently that in the late 1980′s “everyone” was captivated by Nasrallah’s charm etc – whereas the truth is that he was <span><strong>NOT</strong></span> widely regarded and admired until AFTER his elevation as SG. He was regarded as quiet, in general, we know from public hezbollah documents, statements etc.</p>\n<p>– WHERE IS THIS CAFE AL BAS – please someone has to go there and find this “hezbollah” manouche dude with a flag in his desk to prove his membership as a “fighter” – please email me!</p>\n<p>– I like that filkins first describes nasrallah as “roundfaced” when young then later – as if not to care about ANY consistency – he says “when he was younger, Nasrallah gave off the hard stare of a soldier.’ So which is it – a wimpy dweeb or murdering maniac? I am confused <span><strong>by your own descriptions in the same piece.</strong></span></p>\n<p>– Filkins piece in general says that Hezbollah is poised to strike US targets in the event of an attack on iran.. and that all they care about is defeating sunnis – basically they hate everyone, fear everyone and will strike out at anyone.</p>\n<p>But Dexter, I dont get it: if Hizbullah is so freaked out and so primed for striking out wildly at everyone – US, israel, sunnis, tourists etc., then why are they still so evidently the steadiest party in Lebanese politics and managing to maintain position and advantage when most of the greatest powers IN THE WORLD are against them. Compare them regionally and the picture you put forth is not compelling.</p>\n<p>I of course believe Hizbullah is dangerous and should be disarmed, like a number of states and actors in the middle east – but that the best way is for the US to pursue a peaceful negotiating strategy rather than a policy which promotes war and conflict OR which turns a blind eye to reactionary “allies” doing the dirty work. I wrote about this strategy <a href=\"http://tcf.org/publications/2009/3/pb685/?searchterm=lebanon%20track\">here for</a> [oops! new link <a href=\"http://old.tcf.org/publications/2009/3/pb685\">here</a>] New American Foundation and the NY <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/opinion/in-syria-we-need-to-bargain-with-the-devil.html?pagewanted=1\">Times</a>.</p>\n<p>– Oh and a final aside – I dont know when Filkins actually dined with jumblatt, but he has NOT beeen drinking sake or any liquor for at least a year and a half (last time dinner for me was this summer, but he had told me at that time he wasn’t drinking anymore…) because of his health. Which leads me to wonder… was it Filkins who drank too much of Jumblatt’s sake? Can he be exaggerating even these little color details? Could he be that over confident?</p>\n<p>Lets see where this goes – but the bottom line is Dexter has to go and a public accounting needs to happen about how these critical subjects get treated so cavalierly.</p>\n<br><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mideastwire.wordpress.com&blog=13423679&post=2780&subd=mideastwire&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

He brought it in a clay pot (like the one in the picture) and it was covered with a layer of thick yellowish cream. He also brought a straw basket of eggs.

They end up on websites that make little to no effort to ensure correct attribution, and then they spread quicker than an STD in a co-ed dorm in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. </p>\n<p>Quotes also appear to have a new enemy: the tastefully designed inspirational visual. Part of my daily routine involves going through tumblrs to see what the world’s (read: the hipster blogosphere) mood is that day. Although the allegedly meaningful quote set against a Brannan-filtered backdrop has been a staple for years, it now seems to be working its way away from ‘art blogs’ and into the Facebook habits of my bored aunt. </p>\n<p>I see people in my Facebook feed bandying about quotes by Bukowski and Ayn Rand, and I can guarantee they’ve got no clue who either of these people are. That’s not an immense problem on its own. Quotes are often decontextualized, and appropriated in wholly unexpected ways. But the fact that the quote in its current state has basically been reduced to the sharing of a visual, means that the assemblages of carefully crafted words are no longer words at all. Well, not in the lexical sense at least. The letters become visual elements, mined and slapped onto a supporting structure to form a new unitary whole. </p>\n<p>It’s important to remember why we quote. Normally it’s to pay tribute to someone’s work, and their ability to express an opinion better than we ever could. It’s also a convenient and semi-socially acceptable way to tell your friends that you read more than they do. Since the advent of the useable web, it has become the defacto repository for all forms of quotations that would have previously had to fight their way into carefully edited dictionaries. So quotes, even centuries old ones, are as much a part of internet culture as goats that laugh like humans, Nyan cat and the humble LOL. Many people even use them to sign off emails or discussion forum posts. </p>\n<p>As someone who cares about language, this ubiquity kind of worries me. Because once they become pervasive beyond reason, words find their way into the murky shitfest of the cliche, overused to the point of triteness.</p>\n<p>And anyway, to quote Voltaire, “a witty saying proves nothing”. </p>'),

They are not more important than the Law to Protect Women from Family Violence. – Zoya Rouhana, director of KAFA</p>\n</div></h3>\n<p>During the march, speakers blasted at full volume a key part in Nabih Berri’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152554099485694&set=pcb.10152554111195694&type=1&theater\">2009 acceptance speech</a>, in which he said: “The new parliament must enact the necessary legislations to guarantee women’s full participation in the government and society, and their protection from violence, and amend the discriminatory laws in this respect in the Lebanese law.”</p>\n<p>With the parliamentary elections around the corner, MPs had scratched the Law to Protect Women from Family Violence off their agenda to discuss a new electoral law (the <a title=\"Highly Unorthodox\" href=\"http://qifanabki.com/2013/02/20/highly-unorthodox/\">Orthodox-Maronite Gathering law, which reeks of sectarianism, being one of the proposals</a>).</p>\n<p>“We’ve always heard them say that the time is not right to raise issues they consider to be secondary because the fate of the country is at stake,” said Zoya Rouhana, director of the NGO, <a title=\"KAFA (Enough)\" href=\"http://www.kafa.org.lb/\">KAFA</a>, that worked on drafting and promoting the law. “And we’re here to say that our issues and other livelihood issues are not secondary, and that our fate, us women, is at stake.”</p>\n<p>On average, <a title=\"One Woman Dies of Family Violence Every Month in Lebanon\" href=\"http://www.nasawiya.org/web/2012/02/iwd/\">one woman dies every month</a> as a result of family violence in Lebanon, according to logged reports.</p>\n<p>“Women are being killed and nobody utters a word,” Rouhana said. “Women are being tortured and nobody utters a word. Our patriarchal society has long buried these crimes underneath so-called “sanctities” and “privacies” of the family, which you’ve imposed on us in order to tighten your grip and control our lives as you please.”</p>\n<p>Rouhana continued: “No, electoral laws are not more important than the laws we’re demanding. They are not more important than the Law to Protect Women from Family Violence.”</p>\n<p>A draft version of the family violence bill was approved by Lebanon’s Cabinet in 2010. But it has since been languishing in parliament, mainly due to <a href=\"http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/columns/article/lebanese-parliament-fails-to-protect-women-from-violence_5558\">the objections of Sunni and Shia authorities</a>.</p>\n<p>Last year, the <a href=\"http://al-akhbar.com/node/99276\">parliamentary committee reviewing the bill presented a report in which it diluted the language of the law, thus defeating its purpose</a>. Key provisions, including language that would criminalize marital rape, were amended or removed.</p>\n<p>The bill – whether revised or in its original form – still has to be put up for a vote before parliament to pass.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31741521@N08/sets/72157632841950509/\"><b>Click here to view the Photo Gallery “Protest to Demand Domestic Violence Legislation” on

You are used to the  pixelated box with limited angle of vision.That box eventually becomes your reality and unique perception of family, relatives and loved ones far from you physically. It is fascinating how that box can fit your mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, cousin, nephew, neighbors,  the furniture around the house or even a birthday cake. It can become suitable for sharing a breakfast or even going as far as attending a best friend’s <a href=\"http://lebaneseexpatriate.wordpress.com/2012/12/22/wedding-through-skype/\">wedding over skype</a>.</p>\n<p>We all try to stay connected and most importantly we all aspire for a better Lebanon. We all wish for a Lebanon that can offer us what we dream of, a minimum of electricity 24/7, constant potable water, security for our children, medical care, decent public education etc…We all wish we had politicians we could trust, politicians we could entrust the country in their hands. Primarily because of such wishes, because at one point or another, we could not change Lebanon to meet our goals in life, we decided to pursue our dreams somewhere else. We convinced ourselves that it will be temporary, just to see what else is out there. We felt incapable in Lebanon, and followed the mentality:</p>\n<p>We all have expressed or heard such statements at some point:</p>\n<p>“If I cannot make it here, I might as well try somewhere else…”</p>\n<p>“Who am I to change anything about this country? It shall always be run by a bunch of thieves followed by sheep and I no sheep.”</p>\n<p>“Hopeless case. I am better off avoiding stirring up the hornet’s nest. What can I do from abroad anyway?”</p>\n<p>These are all valid points, but with that mentality we can only blame ourselves for what our country is facing. If those who see the wrong decide to run away or simply disregard it, then who is expected to do anything about it?</p>\n<p>You don’t have to be a politician to make a difference. You don’t have to be a full time activist to stand up for your right. You don’t have to dedicate hours every week to support a rally or join a local committee. You do not even have to reside in the country to make any difference.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of Lebanese who understand that change is gradual, that the road to reform is long. They are fully aware that individually they can barely cause a ripple, but collaborating with like-minded Lebanese, they can create one hell of a wave.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. ~Edmund Burke</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://vote2013.org/\">Take Back Parliament </a>is a group of Lebanese activists, students, professionals, journalists, educators and even expatriates who are trying to do something about the system we all criticize and suffer from They do not reign from active or defunct political groups. They do not come from political families, they do not pick their money off a tree. The members of this groups also have 8-5 jobs, they also worry about their future and they have bills to pay, but they see what is wrong with Lebanon and they decided to come together and try to do something about it.</p>\n<p>What is even more interesting about this movement, in addition to being a complete zero-budget grassroots movement,  it have incorporated the Lebanese expatriates from the start, not as a bank like other bigger more established parties, but with full representation and participation in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>YOU CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, EVEN FROM ABROAD. FIND LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS AND COLLABORATE TO ACHIEVE THE DIFFERENCE YOU SEEK.</p>\n<p>For more info about Take Back Parliament, feel free to comment and I will reach out for you via email.

فؤاد السنيورة، مثلا، بتثبيت سعر صرف الليرة لضرورة الامن الاجتماعي اللبناني، اولا، ولاستعادة ثقة المستثمرين الاجانب بلبنان، ثانيا. وفي وقت لاحق، وقف الحريري في مجلس النواب ليشير الى فشل تجربة تركيا اقتصاديا في حينه حتى بعد تخليها عن سياسة تثبيت ليرتها.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nحتى لبنانيون مثل الرئيس سليم الحص ووزيره للمال جورج القرم، عارضا سياسات الحريري قولا، ولكنهما تمسكا بها فعلا، ولم نر الحص في فترة 1998 - 2000 يتخلى عن تثبيت النقد، بل رأينا القرم يمارس المزيد من التقشف، او \"ترشيق الدولة\"، على ما كان يحلو للوزير السنيورة القول.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nاما ارتفاع الدين العام فيرتبط بعناصر عديدة، منها ان البلاد كانت خرجت للتو من حرب اهلية قضت على قدرتها في جباية الضرائب وتحصيل الموارد، ما اضطرها للاستدانة من اجل اعادة الاعمار واعادة تأهيل مؤسساتها، وخصوصا الامنية، والانفاق عموما. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nثم ان الاستدانة، وبسبب الحرب مع اسرائيل، جاءت بفائدة مرتفعة. تلك الحرب نفسها اضطرت لبنان الى استدانة المزيد من النقد الاجنبي من اجل تثبيت سعر صرف الليرة. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nحتى \"اعادة الاعمار\"، لم تكن تماما في يد الحريري، فوزارة \"الموارد المائية والكهربائية\" لم تكن يوما بامرة وزير \"يمون\" عليه، والمعلوم ان \"شركة كهرباء لبنان\" تكلف الخزينة خسائر تقدر بربع الانفاق السنوي، فيما يتكفل الجيش والقوى الامنية بالربع الآخر.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nبعد مقتل الحريري، اقترح امين عام \"حزب الله\" السيد حسن نصرالله على ورثة الحريري، في خطابين له على الاقل، عودة الصيغة السابقة بقوله ما مفاده ان اديروا انتم سياسة اعادة الاعمار ونهتم نحن بالسياستين الخارجية والدفاعية. هذه الثنائية نفسها يبدو ان الرئيس السوري بشار الاسد يقدمها اليوم الى معارضيه، يحتفظ هو بالاجهزة الامنية والسياسة الخارجية، ويتخلى لهم عن الجوانب الاقتصادية والمالية في الحكم.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nلكن التجربة اللبنانية أظهرت انه يصعب التمييز بين السياستين، اذ يستحيل بناء اقتصاد مزدهر في دولة تعج بضباط الجيش والاستخبارات، الذين يمكن ان يستولوا على الاقتصاد وعلى اصحابه، كما حصل في ولاية الرئيس السابق اميل لحود وجميل السيد وصحبهما في مواجهة الحريري. كذلك، يصعب الازدهار الاقتصادي والاجتماعي في بلد يتوعد بعض قادته بالحرب الدائمة والمقاومة المستمرة.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nورثة الحريري في السياسة رفضوا عرض السيد نصرالله، بل اصروا على المشاركة في كل سياسات الحكم، الاقتصادية، كما الدفاعية والخارجية، ما اخرجهم من الحكم تحت طائلة التصفية الجسدية على غرار ما حصل للحريري الاب نفسه. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nعلى ان من تلقف عرض \"حزب الله\" هو الجنرال ميشال عون، الذي ربط الخوف المسيحي بنفوذ الحريري، بدلا من ربطه بأجهزة الامن الرسمية والحزبية الخارجة عن سلطة الدولة. طبعا لم يستنبط عون مواقفه، بل هو استلهمها مما يهوم في بال غالبية المسيحيين، وهو ما يظهر عمق ازمتهم في لبنان.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nالمسيحيون يمتلكهم حنين الى نصف قرن تلا حرب 1860 وحكموا اثناءه لبنانهم الصغير، وسمحت لهم بحبوحتهم المالية المبنية على اقتصاد الحرير ممارسة نفوذ سياسي سمح لهم بالتوسع، بمساعدة فرنسية، وانشاء دولة مبنية على هيمنة اقليتين، المسيحية وتابعتها الشيعية، وعلى اقلية سنية في لبنان تنتمي الى الاكثرية في المنطقة. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nلكن سطوة المسيحيين تراجعت امام المد المالي السني والشيعي في المنطقة. ومع تراجع اقتصادهم، تراجعت اعدادهم، فنفوذهم السياسي. ومازاد في ازمتهم تعقيدا اعتقادهم ان الحلول تأتي من طريق مشايخ الشباب والزعماء \"الاقوياء\" من امثال بشير الجميل او ميشال عون، ومن طريق رؤساء الجمهورية.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nعلى ان ما يحتاجه المسيحيون فعلا لاستعادة دورهم هو اقتصاد مزدهر عموما يثبت الباقين منهم في لبنان، ويعيد بعضا من مهاجريهم. الازدهار الاقتصادي بدوره يحتاج الى بلد ليس في حالة حرب مع احد، او على الاقل حرب بجدول زمني مفهوم. </div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nكما يحتاج الازدهار الى ورشة اصلاح دستورية تؤكد حريات الافراد المسيحيين وحقوقهم، لا حقوق زعمائهم في المناصب. ومن مصلحة المسيحيين كذلك دولة متحررة من الارقام الديموغرافية التي يؤدي تغيرها الدائم الى ضعضعة الصيغة الكيانية بشكل مستمر.</div>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\nهذا هو النقاش المفقود في لبنان، والذي يستعيض عنه ارباب الطوائف بـ \"التجليط\" على شاكلة الشعارات الشعبوية، وتخويف جماعاتهم، واثراء انفسهم، وخوض معارك فارغة حول الميثاق والمناصفة والمثالثة. ويبدو ان غالبية اللبنانيين تغرق في هذه المتاهات، وتتلهى بها عن السياسات التي يمكنها ان تخرج المسيحيين من خوفهم، والشيعة من مظلوميتهم، والسنة من نقمتهم، والدروز من تحولهم الى \"هنود حمر\".</div>\n</div></div>'),

Explaining his intentions, Ambassador <a title=\"British ambassador Tom Fletcher\" href=\"http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/tomfletcher/2012/01/30/lebanon-2020/\">Fletcher writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So we want to start a conversation about Lebanon 2020. To lift debate beyond the year ahead, important as it is. Stability yes, but also growth and reform. A focus on the factors that unite rather than divide. We think that new groups, often disenfranchised, should be central to this conversation: business, civil society, youth. We must of course learn the lessons from the past. But we cannot make progress solely by looking in the rear view mirror.</p>\n<p>Also in Arabic:</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">لذلك نريد أن نبدأ بحوار حول لبنان 2020. علينا أن أن نبدأ بالنقاش – بأهميته – بدءاً بهذا العام، من الإستقرار حتماً إلى النموّ والإصلاح. يجب أن نركّز على العوامل التي تجمعنا عوضاً عن التي تفرقنا. على مجموعات جديدة باستقلالها غالباً أن تكون في اساس هذا الحوار من الأعمال، إلى المجتمع الأهلي والشباب. علينا أن نتعلم من دروس الماضي ولكن لا يمكن إحراز أيّ تقدّم إذا ستمرّينا بالنظر إلى ما مضى.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to Google hangouts, channels opened for the conversation included the hashtag #leb2020, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/@hmatomfletcher\">@hmatomfletcher</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/@ukinlebanon\">@ukinlebanon</a>, and soon, a new space on the <a title=\"UK in Lebanon\" href=\"http://ukinlebanon.fco.gov.uk/en/\">embassy’s website</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>'),

The attacks killed more than 141 people, including 71 children, and caused immense physical destruction.</span></div><div><span>The extent of the damage from a single strike, the lack of aircraft in the area at the time, and reports of ballistic missiles being launched from a military base near Damascus overwhelmingly suggest that government forces struck these areas with ballistic missiles. <i>Human Rights Watch</i> visited the four attack sites, all in residential neighborhoods. <i>Human Rights Watch</i> found no signs of any military targets in the vicinity of any of the four sites, which would mean that the attacks were unlawful.</span></div><div><span>“I have visited many attack sites in Syria, but have never seen such destruction,” said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at <i>Human Rights Watch</i>, who visited the sites. “Just when you think things can’t get any worse, the Syrian government finds ways to escalate its killing tactics.”</span></div><div><span><i>Human Rights Watch</i> compiled a list of those killed from cemetery burial records, interviews with relatives and neighbors, and information from the Aleppo media center and the Violations Documentation Center, a network of local activists.</span></div><div><span>Around midnight on February 18 a missile struck the Jabal Badro neighborhood in Aleppo, killing at least 47 people, including 23 children. According to local residents, government forces started shelling the attack site about 20 minutes after the missile struck, wounding several people. Just before 6 p.m. on February 22, a missile struck the Tariq al-Bab neighborhood in the eastern part of Aleppo, killing at least 13 people, including eight children. Just minutes later, a missile struck the Ard al-Hamra neighborhood close by, killing at least 78 people, including 38 children.</span></div><div><span>The opposition controlled the three neighborhoods, all in the eastern part of Aleppo. While opposition fighters move throughout opposition controlled areas, there had been no ground fighting in these neighborhoods for months, local residents said. The opposition military headquarters known to <i>Human Rights Watch</i> are in other neighborhoods.</span></div><div><span>At the time of the attacks, many people who had initially fled the fighting in August 2012 had returned to the area, as well as people displaced from other parts of the Aleppo governorate. There is ongoing fighting around Aleppo’s international airport, south of the neighborhoods that were struck, but local residents interviewed by <i>Human Rights Watch</i> at each of the sites attacked said that there had been no bases for opposition fighters in the vicinity and that opposition fighters had staged no attacks from these neighborhoods. During its visit, <i>Human Rights Watch</i> confirmed that there was active fighting close to the airport, but not in these neighborhoods.</span></div><div><span>The fourth missile attack documented by <i>Human Rights Watch</i>struck Tel Rifaat, a town in Aleppo countryside, around 9:30 p.m. on February 18, killing three people, including two girls. While there has been no ground fighting in Tel Rifaat for months, Aleppo residents told <i>Human Rights Watch</i> that government forces at a nearby airport under attack by the opposition have repeatedly shelled the town, causing the majority of residents to flee. During previous visits <i>Human Rights Watch</i> met with opposition commanders in Tel Rifaat, but never in the area that was struck. Local residents told <i>Human Rights Watch</i> that no fighters had been there.</span></div><div><span><i>Human Rights Watch</i> research indicates that at least 141 people, including 71 children, were killed in the four attacks. <i>Human Rights Watch</i> was not able to establish the first name of six of the 141 documented casualties.</span></div><div><span>The total casualty number is probably higher, <i>Human Rights Watch</i> said. Since many families left the areas after the attack and buried family members in surrounding villages, the records are probably incomplete.</span></div><div><span>Relatives at the attack sites told <i>Human Rights Watch</i>that they continued to search for people believed to be still buried under the rubble. During <i>Human Rights Watch</i>’s visit to the attack site in Ard al-Hamra on February 24, two days after the attack, local residents found the body of a woman who had been buried under the rubble. A family member told <i>Human Rights Watch</i> that they were still looking for other members of her family.</span></div><div><span>In each site, the attack had completely destroyed 15 to 20 houses and significantly damaged many more.</span></div><div><span><i>Human Rights Watch</i> did not find weapons remnants at the attack sites, and so was unable to identify the exact weapons used. However, a group of local activists in the Damascus countryside reported on their Facebook page that they had observed missiles being launched toward the north before three of the four strikes.</span></div><div><span>At 9:38 p.m. on February 18, the local coordination council in Yabroud <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Yabroud.Revolution?ref=stream\"><span><span>posted</span></span></a>on its Facebook site that it had observed a “scud missile” in the sky over Yabroud at 9:05 p.m., heading toward northern Syria. Witnesses in Tel Rifaat told <i>Human Rights Watch</i> that a missile hit the town around 9:30 p.m. on February 18.</span></div><div><span>Likewise, on February 22, the Yabroud coordination council <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Yabroud.Revolution/posts/546049868749112\"><span><span>reported</span></span></a>that it had seen three “scud missiles” flying northward around 5:30 p.m. Just before 6 p.m., the Yabroud council <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Yabroud.Revolution/posts/546057295415036\"><span><span>reported</span></span></a>that missiles had hit Aleppo. <i>Human Rights Watch</i> has not documented any warning of the attack that hit the Jabal Bardo neighborhood in Aleppo shortly around midnight on February 18.</span></div><div><span>The level of destruction and witness statements describing a single explosion at each site is consistent with the use of ballistic missiles. Witnesses also told <i>Human Rights Watch</i> that they did not see or hear any airplanes before or after the attack, which makes it unlikely that the attacks were airstrikes.</span></div><div><span>Syria stockpiles several types of ballistic missiles according to the authoritative publication Military Balance 2011 by the International Institute of Strategic Studies.</span></div><div><span>A Syrian government official <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2013/Feb-25/207853-syria-regime-denies-firing-scud-missiles-at-rebels-report.ashx#axzz2Lw8r5WTW\"><span><span>denied</span></span></a>that the authorities had used Scud-missiles against the opposition. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPC0Udeof3T7n60nL2ptkGgfjEztggeT9\"><span><span>Several videos</span></span></a>from different dates posted on YouTube, however, show Syrian military forces launching ballistic missiles.

Since then, activists have counted more than 30 attacks with such missiles before the attacks documented in this report. Several of them have landed in fields without causing any damage, they said. Activists in Yabroud have claimed on their Facebook page that the government has launched the missiles from the nearby al-Nasiriyah air base, north of Damascus city. The Local Coordination Committees, a network of opposition activists, have <a href=\"http://www.lccsyria.org/10960\"><span><span>accused</span></span></a> the 155<sup>th</sup>Brigade based near Damascus of launching the missiles.</span></div><div><span>“Using ballistic missiles against its own people is a new low, even for this government,” Solvang said. “There was no sign of fighters or their bases in these areas, only civilians, many of them children.”</span></div>'),

Regular readers will know that I previously wrote about this topic, but I want to address an issue that I’ve been thinking about for a while, something that Antoun’s post helped crystallize in my mind. It has to do with the perception in Lebanon of secular liberals .</p>\n<h2>Meet the liberal stereotype</h2>\n<p>Whenever people in Lebanon talk about “secular” and “liberal” folks, there is a tendency to think of godless leftist demonstrators fighting for workers’ rights, gay rights, womens’ rights and foreign domestic workers’ rights in small demonstrations. These people are usually highly educated “elites” that are “disconnected” from the reality on the ground and too “westernized” (I’m quoting words that Antoun used in his post)</p>\n<p>Antoun repeated that stereotype, believing that the people above are the ones who could benefit from the election law, if only they worked hard enough to get closer to the concerns of the real voters. In that worldview “Liberals” and “seculars” belong by definition to the fringe, since because of Lebanon’s sectarian politics only people who are outside of the system can be <em>truly</em> secular and liberal.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this is a superficial and non-inclusive understanding of who Lebanon’s liberals are.</p>\n<h2>Pragmatic liberals</h2>\n<p>If you think of secular people as those who believe in a separation of mosque/church and state and who primarily work toward achieving that objective, then you’ll be right to assume that none of the existing mainstream political parties are liberal or secular. But what if we broaden our perception to include people who are secular at heart and spirit, but who are working within the system to improve the country’s economic and developmental metrics, perhaps until it the population is more amenable to a true separation of religion and state?</p>\n<p>What if liberals in a position of responsibility decided that co-opting religious leaders is less costly to the country than confronting them, even if in their hearts of hearts they don’t believe that sheikhs and priests should be doing any kind of statecraft?</p>\n<p>The problem with a purist interpretation of the words liberalism and secularism, with the prerequisite that religion be completely shut out of public life, is that it will make you think that secularism in Lebanon requires either a “revolution” in the classic sense of the word, or a monstrosity like the Elie Ferzli (a.k.a Orthodox gathering) election law to bring the fringes into mainstream political life.</p>\n<h2>“Snap to grid” politics</h2>\n<p>In Photoshop and other image editing software, there’s a handy setting called “snap to grid” which makes it automatic for graphic elements on a page to “snap” to prepared guidelines. It’s a great feature for aligning graphical elements and obtaining order, but it comes at the cost of flexibility: If you try to place a circle between two guidelines, it will immediately snap and align with the one closest to it, it cannot be placed in the middle.</p>\n<p>There’s a similar dynamic going on in Lebanese politics. If a politcal party with a secular manifesto gets slightly close to a certain sect (usually the one the founder of the party belongs to), either for political expediency or for electoral posturing, –SNAP!– the party is immediately cast as a sectarian party. There is very little that party can do to prove that it’s not motivated by narrow sectarian interests, so it decides to play along, sometimes covertly, and sometimes overtly.</p>\n<p>Antoun mentions the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) and the Future Movement (FM) as two examples of parties that have “failed” as secular projects despite the original intentions of their founders. We all know that Michel Aoun was not driven by sectarianism before. We also know that Saad Hariri is no religious zealot (as proved by his latest support for civil marriage). But they were both pushed by the system, –Snap!– into the role that people wanted of them: That of sectarian leaders.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, both parties belong to the center-right in economic policies. That is a further reason why the Lebanese people can’t see them as secular. Somehow in Lebanon people associate secularism with the left, perhaps because of the left’s tradition of blunt anti-religious discourse, and the age-old “communist” accusation, which is interchangeable in many minds with the word “atheist”.</p>\n<h2>Why I don’t want to “take back parliament”</h2>\n<p>I like to think of myself as a secular person. I’m religiously agnostic and I think sheikhs and priests don’t belong to public life. I even get angry when I see them on TV. But I won’t be voting for <a href=\"http://vote2013.org/\">“take back parliament”</a>, an admirable effort by Nadine Moawad to use social media to come up with an alternative to the current political class, even if it markets itself as a secular movement.</p>\n<p>The reason is simple: I like secular parties, but I also want to like their policies. From the slogans I’ve seen in facebook from <em>Take back parliament</em>‘s page, I realized that this party is too left-leaning for my taste. I like social justice, but I’m not a fan of extreme redistributive policies that will leave my country broke in no time.</p>\n<p>This means that I will end up voting for the “same old faces”. I will gladly strike out the names of Khaled el Daher and Abou el 3Abed Kabbara because I am sick of their overt sectarian discourse, and I will probably replace them with Mikati and Safadi because they know a thing or two about managing finances.</p>\n<p>But does that mean that I, or tens of thousands like me in all sects, are not secular or liberal? You wish..</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=OC5c5EnIYmc:BwO7r2OwHB8:J3aVl1i_38o\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=J3aVl1i_38o\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/beirutspring/fb_feed/~4/OC5c5EnIYmc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">'),

Malls have their own centralization as well: I will call it Mall Centralization: <em>Al Markaziye Al Malliyé</em>.</p>\n<p>Prior to ABC’s grand Verdun-related unveiling, CinemaCity had announced that they will be bringing their cinema experience to Beirut Souks, a souk-mall hybrid that we are all familiar with.<br>\nWith that, let’s look at the total tally of malls and cinemas in Beirut and immediately around it:<br>\n- LeMall in Dbayyeh<br>\n- ABC Dbayyeh, less than 200 meters from LeMall<br>\n- CityMall, a few kilometers from ABC Dbayyeh<br>\n- ABC Achrafieh, a few kilometers from CityMall<br>\n- LeMall, Sin el Fil, a few kilometers from ABC Achrafieh<br>\n- Beirut Souks, a few kilometers from ABC Achrafieh<br>\n- ABC Verdun, a few kilometers from both Beirut Souks and ABC Achrafieh.</p>\n<p>All of the above malls have (or will have) multiplex cinemas in them as well.</p>\n<p>Which other Lebanese cities have malls other than Beirut? I can think of Saida and that’s mainly because it’s Mr. Hariri’s hometown. If you go North from Beirut, you will find no malls and no cinemas until Las Salinas in the North and City Complex in Tripoli, both cinemas only with the latter having a few stores here and there and both of which are nowhere near decent enough to show movies. </p>\n<p>Tripoli is Lebanon’s second biggest city and hasn’t had any major construction projects that found their way to completion even during the periods when the city didn’t experience the clashes that take place today.</p>\n<p>And let’s assume Tripoli is a big no-no for political reasons, despite that being downright despicable, what’s wrong in having similar development in Batroun or Jbeil? You know, something to serve those who don’t want to drive an hour in order to watch a movie to buy a shirt. </p>\n<p>So while places like Beirut Souks ruin the idea of an old fashioned Souk and while places like ABC Achrafieh overcrowd neighborhoods that are already beyond crowded with cars and traffic, someone saw it fit to add another mall in an empty space in Beirut. Because the city absolutely needed one.</p>\n<p>I won’t go into how malls affect negatively smaller retailers that create bustling streets and bring life to some aspects of urban life in Beirut. A metropolitan place like Beirut should have malls and such projects, there’s no denying that. </p>\n<p>But the question is the following: What’s Lebanon’s Mall Centralization limit? </p>\n<p>I say it’s until every single empty space in Beirut runs out. </p>\n<p>Other places in the country don’t (and won’t have) have similar developmental projects hat would bring jobs and some economic life to arguably an entire region.</p>\n<p>Flipping the coin of Lebanon’s mall centralization, and in broader terms the centralization of capital, economy and development, is rise in poverty and consequently extremism. But there’s no point in caring – Beirut is getting a new mall soon. The other twenty right next to it were not enough.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a> Tagged: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/abc/\">ABC</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/achrafieh/\">Achrafieh</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/beirut/\">Beirut</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/beirut-souks/\">Beirut Souks</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/citymall/\">CityMall</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lemall/\">LeMall</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/mall/\">Mall</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/verdun/\">Verdun</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/5979/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/5979/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=5979&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

Lawrence bangs on his desk with the butt of his gun to bring the assembly to order, but to no avail. Chaos erupts. Now something similar is happening in Syria. A mountain of dead (<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-activists-say-battle-between-army-rebels-for-aleppo-airport-intensifies/2013/02/23/9b17f17e-7da8-11e2-9073-e9dda4ac6a66_story.html\"><span><span>70,000 or so</span></span></a>), not to mention an approaching regional bloodbath, suggests that once again things are coming apart. Still, life does not exactly imitate art. Lawrence of Arabia at least tried to do something. Barack of D.C. just sat on his hands.</span></div><div><span>Actually, he sat on his polling numbers. The president’s refusal to do anything material to end the Syrian civil war is a policy long suspected of having two elements — fear of blowback and fear of the nightly news. Now comes a book from a one-time administration insider who bluntly and altogether convincingly outlines the role domestic political considerations played in the White House’s approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The goal of policymakers was “not to make strategic decisions but to satisfy public opinion.” Syria, it seems, has been no exception.</span></div><div><span>The former insider is the resplendently credentialed Vali Nasr, dean of the <a href=\"http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/academics/schools/school_of_advanced_international_studies/\"><span><span>Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies</span></span></a>, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, life member of the Council on Foreign Relations and, most pertinently, former senior adviser to the late Richard Holbrooke, President Obama’s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. In that capacity, Nasr says he saw the almost daily humbling of Holbrooke, a volcano of a diplomat who was forever erupting ideas, plans and strategies — almost always to no avail. In his telling, the White House was some sort of high school cafeteria where Holbrooke was always being shunned and given the silent treatment. He blames “a small cabal of relatively inexperienced White House advisers whose turf was strictly politics” for this. Mean Girls, not the Wise Men, made American policy.</span></div><div><span>Nasr set down his views in a book called “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038553647X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=038553647X&linkCode=as2&tag=slatmaga-20\"><span><span>The Dispensable Nation</span></span></a>.” It will be published in April, but samizdat copies of it are already being circulated. In a sense, the book only confirms the general impression that Obama is a man without a foreign policy. He had naive aspirations — a world to be changed by the transformative power of a good speech — but no clear path to achieve anything. Nasr describes his dismay when the surge in Afghanistan was announced in tandem with a pullout date. In his head, Secretary of State John Kerry, the new implementer of Obama’s contradictory policy, must now hear a reprise of the question <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2004/2/20/john_kerry_then_hear_kerrys_historic\"><span><span>he once asked</span></span></a>about his own war: “How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam?”</span></div><div><span>Nasr’s regional specialty was Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the thrust of what he says supports the view that Obama shied from intervening in Syria out of domestic political considerations. A president who was campaigning as the peace candidate — out of Iraq and, soon, Afghanistan, too — could not risk anything bold in Syria. The country fell into the margin of error. “It is not going too far to say that American foreign policy has become completely subservient to tactical domestic political considerations,” <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038553647X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=038553647X&linkCode=as2&tag=slatmaga-20\"><span><span>Nasr writes</span></span></a>.</span></div><div><span>Boldness is what the situation in Syria demanded. A civil war that could have been contained has instead become a sprawling, regionwide bar fight. Arms could have been shipped to the insurgents; a no-fly zone could have been imposed. Much could have been done. Instead, Obama merely called for Bashar al-Assad to go and, for some reason he, like Rep. Eric Cantor or somebody, remains immovable.</span></div><div><span>The stakes here are enormous. Lebanon teeters, swamped with refugees. Jordan, too, is overwhelmed. The Kurds in Syria’s north may, as they have in nearby Iraq, establish an autonomous zone — and Turkey will not be pleased. The jihadists are on the move, hungry for Syria’s vast store of chemical weapons. Israel watches, nervously. What if Hezbollah gets its hands on chemical weapons? An Obama administration, afraid of blowback, may well have allowed the Middle East to blow apart.</span></div><div><span>The battle for Damascus is now engaged. The war next month enters its third year, a humanitarian crisis that has been permitted to fester under the rubric of foreign policy realism. But another realism is now apparent: Inaction has bred the manufacture of orphans — a carnage, a horror, a reprimand to inaction. Life imitates art. Damascus is where it all came apart in “Lawrence of Arabia.” Damascus is where it is coming apart in reality.</span></div>'),

Being the most important event of the year, the ladies outdid themselves and there was barely anything to critisize this time, unfortunately for me. </p>\n<p><span><strong>POWDER SHADES:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/b383aaf5806807e6d4bf1a658ca1b844/tumblr_inline_misds5RToz1qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Amanda Seyfried in Alexander McQueen: </strong>I really don’t believe an “ugly” Alexander McQueen dress will ever exist. Amanda looks beautiful. </p>\n<p><strong>Amy Adams in Oscar de la Renta: </strong> Couture at its best. I love seeing Amy in pale colors and princess cuts. I’d actually love to wear that dress myself. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Amanda-Seyfried/466963260014327?group_id=0\"><br></a></p>\n<p><strong>Anne Hathaway in Prada:</strong> This dress may look too simple, but it has detailing in the back. Plus, that pose makes her look constipated. </p>\n<p><strong>Charlize Theron in Dior HC: </strong>Simple and to the point, this minimal gown fits her perfectly. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Amanda-Seyfried/466963260014327?group_id=0\"><br></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span><strong>MY FAVORITE:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/bcb4817abc320b5c188bc42a863c5d7c/tumblr_inline_miseb2fuqW1qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Because <strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong> chose to wear my favorite dress out of the <strong>Dior Spring/Summer 2013 Couture Collection,</strong> she deserves exposure of her own. I’m glad that Jennifer kept the jewelry minimal and kept her neckline exposed. But quite frankly, I’m not glad that she tripped over in THAT DRESS whilst walking over to accept her Best Actress Award. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/2b79aef0663df8ad07ed4ffc4b92df4c/tumblr_inline_misemsTixm1qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jessica <strike>Rabbit</strike> Chastain in Armani Prive</strong>: I now realize that I watch the red carpet mostly to see what Jessica will be wearing. Always red-carpet worthy, Jessica looks stunning in this figure-hugging number that compliments her cherry hair.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen Stewart in Reem Acra</strong>: It literally looks like she did her hair and makeup, fell asleep, woke up 30 minutes late and rushed to the red carpet- that being her nasty signature look. </p>\n<p><strong>Catherine Zeta Jones in Zuhair Murad</strong>: Those spirals on the end of that gown creep me out. </p>\n<p><span><strong>METALLICS</strong></span>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/b7788f88388be325fa7eac32a3071d87/tumblr_inline_miseyuQumA1qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Halle Berry in Versace</strong>: First of all, I’m sick of her repetitive hairstyle. The dress is very cool, but if her hair were different, her whole look wouldn’t look as old fashion as it does now. </p>\n<p><strong>Naomi Watts in Armani Prive</strong>: I love the asymmetric cuts of this dress, and I love that it’s done in sequins.</p>\n<p><strong>Nicole Kidman in L’Wren Scott</strong>: What’s with the spirals? They’re so ugly. If we cut off the skirt and just elongate the top part all the way down, in a simple, straight cut, it would’ve looked hot. </p>\n<p><strong>Stacey Keibler in Naeem Khan</strong>: This is interesting; she looks likes like a female version of a knight in a shining armour. </p>\n<p><span><strong>BLACKS:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/2efd9fd29bd37d847f2bab72a7c77284/tumblr_inline_mish1o1xhU1qz4rgp.jpg\"></strong></span></p>\n<p><strong>Adele in Jenny Packham:</strong> Safe choice</p>\n<p><strong>Kristin Chenoweth in Tony Ward</strong>: It’s okay but I do wish the black beading continued all the way down. </p>\n<p><strong>Salma Hayek in Alexander McQueen</strong>: Flawless! Velvet and embellishment are the perfect combo to chic and elegant. And the hairdo was a great choice, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandra Bullock in Elie Saab</strong>: Very pretty and appropriate for her.  </p>\n<p><span><strong>MONOCHROMES:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/1f1d29cbcf2b12e764bb0bee6c573a6d/tumblr_inline_misgn4wMpd1qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly Rowland in Donna Karan</strong>: Sexy and sharp, but aren’t those bangs a little too long?</p>\n<p><strong>Zoe Saldan in Alexis Mabille</strong>: The gradation in color is interesting but I dislike the beginning part of that, where there is a slit. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/d283bc69caa7274fb3bf32b435ad54fa/tumblr_inline_misgvhb08O1qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p><span><strong>Jennifer Aniston in Valentino</strong>: A bit too simple, don’t you think?</span></p>\n<p><span><strong> Olivia Munn in Marchesa</strong>: This dress is fresh off the AW13 runway! I love it and I love that it appeared on the red carpet shortly after its first viewing. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong> Sally Field in Valentino HC</strong>: This reminds me of Rihanna’s dress at the Grammy’s. It’s a chic choice for Sally. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>POP SHADES:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/60cccaa4be6b80f37da3d7cc7d751a07/tumblr_inline_misj0mavw91qz4rgp.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>Kerry Washington in Miu Miu</strong>: Gorgeous color on her!</p>\n<p><strong>Reese Witherspoon in Louis Vuitton:</strong> I was actually waiting to see if anyone was going to wear LV  to the oscars this year. Reese looked great!</p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Garner in Gucci</strong>: The simple cut is enough for this attractive color. </p>\n<p><strong>Jane Fonda in Versace:</strong> I could tell this was Versace just because of that signature canary color. </p>'),

It’s one of my favorite places in Gemmayeh because of the good, good music they play. It’s always beautiful house music toned down just right to enjoy a chill drink after work, but also shake what your mamas gave you if you feel like it.</p>\n<p>The 3-story complex had it all, a rooftop lounge-bar to enjoy the sights and sounds of Beirut’s Gemmayzeh, a middle-level for some good food and a ground-level bar and terrace for drinks, surrounded by bare concrete mixed with traditional Lebanese stone masonry. The screen with photos of Beirut’s golden age in the 1950s were like the cherry on top, and the place always put a smile on my face.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Alcazar is coming back. The rooftop lounge has been revamped and so has the ground floor and terrace. The new Alcazar is gonna ramp up the artsy, retro spirit, with Nintendo memorabilia, jukeboxes and other awesome stuff we miss.</p>\n<p>The nicest part of this leak though, is that the middle-level will now be a space for artists to showcase their art for free. In fact, if you show up there, talk to the manager and see how you can get your artwork featured for everyone to see in this venue on the “Daraj El Fan” we are used to seeing decorated with the fine creative talents we have in Beirut.</p>\n<p>Here are some shots of Alcazar. Note that the tables on the first floor will be gone, making way for the art gallery.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/02/25/alcazar-reopening-march-1st/img_9977/\" title=\"IMG_9977\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_9977.jpg?w=150&h=100\" alt=\"IMG_9977\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/02/25/alcazar-reopening-march-1st/img_9962/\" title=\"IMG_9962\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_9962.jpg?w=150&h=100\" alt=\"IMG_9962\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/02/25/alcazar-reopening-march-1st/img_9944/\" title=\"IMG_9944\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_9944.jpg?w=150&h=100\" alt=\"IMG_9944\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/2013/02/25/alcazar-reopening-march-1st/img_9938-1/\" title=\"IMG_9938-1\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_9938-1.jpg?w=150&h=100\" alt=\"IMG_9938-1\"></a>\n\n<p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12244/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12244/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12244&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p>'),

I started this week on the blog’s Facebook page with most of the dresses that we could see on the Oscars’ red carpet yesterday night. I gave you all the choice of telling us if you think the celebrities’ look are IN or OUT. Make sure to do!</span><br><span> Nevertheless, I want to share with you my Top 6 Best dressed of this edition of the Oscars!</span><br><strong><span> 1. Amy Adams in Oscar De La Renta & Mouawad Jewelry: </span></strong><span>One of my favorite looks, she looked like a little cloud. The color is very subtle and I love the movements of the skirt. I was also extremely proud to learn that she wore amazing pieces from Lebanese jeweler, Mouawad!</span><br><span> <a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/164401_491814680866459_1688945628_n.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10008]\"><span><img title=\"164401_491814680866459_1688945628_n\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/164401_491814680866459_1688945628_n.jpg\" alt=\"164401 491814680866459 1688945628 n Lana reviews: My TOP 6 Best dressed at Oscars 2013\" width=\"600\" height=\"438\"></span></a> <strong>2. Charlize Theron in Dior Couture: </strong>Although, I would have seen her adding a gorgeous sparkling diamond necklace to her look, it was really a no-mistake for the south-African beauty. Loved the makeup!</span><br><span> <a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/533141_491814707533123_738487110_n.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10008]\"><span><img title=\"533141_491814707533123_738487110_n\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/533141_491814707533123_738487110_n.jpg\" alt=\"533141 491814707533123 738487110 n Lana reviews: My TOP 6 Best dressed at Oscars 2013\" width=\"645\" height=\"960\"></span></a> <strong>3. Halle Berry in custom-made L’Atelier Versace: </strong>I’m a long sleeves lover when it comes to evening gowns. I think Halle Berry went for the perfect cut to flatter her amazing body. It was shiny just enough and so Oscar-like!</span><br><span> <a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/542679_491814774199783_1957931725_n.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10008]\"><span><img title=\"542679_491814774199783_1957931725_n\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/542679_491814774199783_1957931725_n.jpg\" alt=\"542679 491814774199783 1957931725 n Lana reviews: My TOP 6 Best dressed at Oscars 2013\" width=\"570\" height=\"857\"></span></a><strong>4. Salma Hayek in Alexander McQueen: </strong>I rarely appreciate Salma Hayek’s choices when it comes to red carpet awards but this time I’m in love. Dark blue velvet combined with this gorgeous work on the neck gave an amazing result! She looked SO glam, great makeup as well! Wished her hair bun was smaller!</span><br><span> <a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/vxRKgn6IsyWl.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10008]\"><span><img title=\"vxRKgn6IsyWl\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/vxRKgn6IsyWl.jpg\" alt=\"vxRKgn6IsyWl Lana reviews: My TOP 6 Best dressed at Oscars 2013\" width=\"411\" height=\"594\"></span></a> <strong>5. Fan BingBing in Marchesa: </strong>Perhaps what caught my attention is the color of the dress. I like how simple yet gorgeous this gown is. The duchess cut is just amazing for someone as skinny as Fan BingBing and the color is perfect for her skin tone! Gorgeous hair & makeup!</span><br><span> <a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/article-0-184127D9000005DC-476_470x646.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10008]\"><span><img title=\"article-0-184127D9000005DC-476_470x646\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/article-0-184127D9000005DC-476_470x646.jpg\" alt=\"article 0 184127D9000005DC 476 470x646 Lana reviews: My TOP 6 Best dressed at Oscars 2013\" width=\"470\" height=\"646\"></span></a> <strong>6. Amanda Seyfried in Alexander McQueen: </strong>The details of this dress are to die for! I would have seen her with simple effortless wavy hair instead of this hair up-do that makes her look way older than her age!</span><br><span> <a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/581730_491814650866462_101807593_n.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10008]\"><span><img title=\"581730_491814650866462_101807593_n\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/581730_491814650866462_101807593_n.jpg\" alt=\"581730 491814650866462 101807593 n Lana reviews: My TOP 6 Best dressed at Oscars 2013\" width=\"480\" height=\"700\"></span></a><strong>7. Sandra Bullock in Elie Saab: </strong>Gorgeous dress, fabulous details, this dress from the SS13 collection is a winner for an event like the Oscars. It’s just disappointing that her hair is so straight, it makes her look older. I would have seen her in a small hair up-do with a fire red lipstick!</span><br><span> <a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/524770_491814767533117_21190614_n.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[10008]\"><span><img title=\"524770_491814767533117_21190614_n\" src=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/524770_491814767533117_21190614_n.jpg\" alt=\"524770 491814767533117 21190614 n Lana reviews: My TOP 6 Best dressed at Oscars 2013\" width=\"342\" height=\"456\"></span></a>So this is it for me!!

He knows it’s illegal for them do so. But he won’t take any measures. If you don’t believe me, check out the following picture I took of the highlights of his interview with LBC:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://stateofmind13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130225-141926.jpg\"><img alt=\"20130225-141926.jpg\" src=\"http://stateofmind13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130225-141926.jpg?w=630\"></a><br>\nTo “clarify” his decision not to pursue the illegal matter, he said it could be the municipality’s way of pressuring those who might want to mess with its security.<br>\nAs if that is remotely acceptable.</p>\n<p>The Municipality of Betchay is racist, yes. Their mayor went on TV to say the following: “We obviously mean Syrians with “foreigners” because French and Europeans won’t be driving Vespas after hours in our village.”<br>\nAnd despite such statements, our minister of interior still wants to let things slide. What can you expect from someone who believes a bomb exploding in Tripoli is “a bunch of people playing with it?”</p>\n<p>The problem isn’t that the municipality has a backward mentality that should not be accepted. It’s with an administration that is so entrenched in apathy that they’d rather let such grave violations slide without doing anything about it.</p>\n<p>I don’t care what the municipality of Betchay’s justification behind such a banner and decision is. If any entity in this country, especially one that is supposed to run the affairs of other people, broke laws in such a flagrant way, it should face the repercussions that such illegalities entail. It shouldn’t face an over-philosophical minister who doesn’t want to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>Lebanon currently has over 300,000 Syrian refugees. They are spread across the land. All our towns have Syrians currently in our midst. The difference is our towns didn’t see it fit to break the law in order to prove a point that is mute to say the least. Not that it would matter anyway with Marwan Charbel in charge.</p>\n<p>Let’s categorize this as a massive failure in humongous scales. Now who wants to play hide and seek with a few Khaybar missiles? No one will mind.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/category/miscellaneous/\">Miscellaneous</a> Tagged: <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/baabda/\">Baabda</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/bechtay/\">Bechtay</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lebanon/\">Lebanon</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/marwan-charbel/\">Marwan Charbel</a>, <a href=\"http://stateofmind13.com/tag/racism/\">Racism</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6425/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6425/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=6425&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

Apart from the highly anticipated opening of City Centre Mall in Sin el Fil very soon, ABC and Verdun 1544 Holding (a Bahaa Rafic Hariri Group company) announced the building of a 200-million dollar, 170-thousand square meter mall in the posh Beirut area of Verdun.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the people involved had to say</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The project’s timing comes within the sensitive political and economic situation facing Lebanon and the Arab world,” said MP Robert Fadel, ABC Chairman and CEO. “Our faith in Lebanon and our trust in the future of its economy made us more determined to proceed with such a huge project that will attract the residents of greater Beirut. ABC Verdun will be a quantum leap in the retail sector and mall management not only in Verdun but in Lebanon while generating more than 2000 job opportunities”, he added.</p>\n<p>“It is with great pleasure that we signed a strategic partnership with ABC, the first Lebanese and probably regional entity to develop and manage shopping centers”, said Mr. Jamil Jamil Bayram, who signed on behalf of Bahaa Rafic Hariri Group the memorandum of understanding with ABC. “Starting today, Verdun street must get ready to welcome the largest commercial entertaining project that will constitute a breakthrough for all Lebanese as well as tourists, especially from the Arab countries”, he added. “Our strong belief in the future of Lebanon and its people, encouraged us to invest in this milestone project for the benefit of future generations”, he concluding, stating :” It is not the first real estate project for Bahaa Rafic Hariri Group in Lebanon, possibly the largest, but not the last- God willing”.</p>\n<p><em>source: <a href=\"http://www.ifpinfo.com/Top-MiddleEast-NewsArticle-2143\">IFPinfo.com</a></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I think it’s cool, especially at a time when rumors of the Hariri family’s wealth dwindling have been heard in salon talks, and the future of Lebanon uncertain with each new day of stupid laws, bad government, even worse living conditions and a the region as a whole in shambles.</p>\n<p>But, do we <em>really</em> need another mall that big so close to ABC Ashrafieh and Beirut Souks? I’d say yes, I like my variety when it comes to choosing cool places to hang out. I also think it’s a bit risky in a place like Verdun, where I remember just last summer we were at a Verdun rooftop watching the clashes on Tareek el Jdide and had RPGs for fireworks and bullets instead of champagne bottle corks…</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/abc_verdun.jpg\"><img alt=\"abc_Verdun\" src=\"http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/abc_verdun.jpg?w=610&h=441\" width=\"610\" height=\"441\"></a></p>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12239/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12239/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12239&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

All four stress points have the potential to turn things in the country upside down in one fell swoop. Like in that photo, what is standing between lebanon and complete chaos is a flimsy barrier and an ill-equipped state. We rely on the sense of responsibility of the people and on the realisation that all bets are off once things break lose. </p>\n<p>But the stress on all sides is strong and keeps getting stronger. Something will have to give, and all it takes is one person to cross the line for complete chaos to follow. This is a grave moment filled with foreboding in Lebanon. We all have to be very cautious and responsible, but that still won’t guarantee a safe crossing to the other side.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=gxh8p7QMkHc:wZpvigSVABc:J3aVl1i_38o\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=J3aVl1i_38o\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/beirutspring/fb_feed/~4/gxh8p7QMkHc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">'),

This year was no exception. Pale shades reigned as did the gold and black combos. Here’s Part 1 of my list of the fabulous and not-so appealing looks for the night.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jessica-chastain.jpg\"><img alt=\"Jessica Chastain\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jessica-chastain.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<p>She was one of the first to arrive and she sure did not disappoint already having topped many’s best dressed list. Best actress nominee Jessica Chastain looked Oscar-worthy in this strapless champagne Armani Privé dress matching the color of her hair and fire red lips and side swept hair. Safe and sober but glamorous nevertheless. She also got to wear 1960 Harry Winston jewels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/naomi-watts.jpg\"><img alt=\"Naomi watts\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/naomi-watts.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<p>Naomi Watts wore one of my favorite dresses of the night, a shimmering metallic sequin, one-shouldered cap-sleeve Armani Privé gown and Neil Lane jewels. Her hair was just the right combo of made-up and messy. best dressed, hands down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/rene-zel.jpg\"><img alt=\"Rene Zel\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/rene-zel.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<div>\n<p>Sizzling! Someone has been putting some extra extra hours at the gym. Renee Zellweger channeled her inner Oscar in this body-sculpting gold  Carolina Herrera. The dress fit her like a glove although not many pale actresses can pull of this look, she stunned!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/charlize-theron.jpg\"><img alt=\"Charlize Theron\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/charlize-theron.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<p>Charlize Theron looked flawless this bleach white peplum Christian Dior Haute Couture dress that managed to look fabulous with her new pixie haircut. Red carpet glamor at it finest hour and one of my favorite looks for the night!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/halle-berry.jpg\"><img alt=\"Halle Berry\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/halle-berry.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<p>She been disappointing as of lately but Halle Berry makes up for all her <a href=\"http://ivysays.com/2013/01/14/the-best-and-worst-dressed-on-the-2013-golden-globes-red-carpet/\">recent fashion faux pas</a> in this edgy custom-made long sleeved and striped Versace gown. The only thing I don’t approve of  his that hair that looks like she slept on one side of her head.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jennifer-lawrence.jpg\"><img alt=\"Jennifer lawrence\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jennifer-lawrence.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Who doesn’t love Jennifer Lawrence? First she announces she’s “starving” and then she trips as she accept her Oscar. But she looked graceful and feminine in Dior Haute Couture dress with a voluminous skirt and Chopard jewels. I’m not gonna lie, I’m not into these multi-shaped gowns and I’m not sure going strapless is the best look for her but the entire world seems to have fallen in love with her nevertheless.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/anne-hathaway.jpg\"><img alt=\"Anne Hathaway\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/anne-hathaway.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<p>Anne Hathaway may have taken the Oscar home for best supporting actress but her choice of this backless pink satin dress by Prada wasn’t a good one at all. First of all it didn’t do any justice for her nipples which seemed to be the most buzzed body part after Angelina Jolie’s leg took center stage last year.  It also looked like she was wearing an apron from behind. And her Liza Minelli hairdo just didn’t do it for me though her floral necklace from Tiffany & Co. was fabulous! But doesn’t her dress look like it needs a good iron? I still love her though!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cathrine-zeta-jones.jpg\"><img alt=\"Cathrine Zeta Jones\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cathrine-zeta-jones.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<p>Catherine Zeta Jones donned this fabulous looking gold metallic swirl detail Zuhair Murad strapless gown. The earrings were a total over-kill, way too much going on there and the fact that her retro hair was split in the middle and not on the side, did not do her any justice at all!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/amy-adams.jpg\"><img alt=\"amy adams\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/amy-adams.jpg?w=500&h=730\" height=\"730\" width=\"500\"></a>Each year an A-lister puts on an big frilly show-stopping Oscar de la Renta  and this year it was the beautiful Amy Adams in this lavender beaded bust dress with asymmetric raw edge ruffles. One of my favorite classic red carpet looks for the night.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/reese-witherspoon-oscars-2013.jpg\"><img alt=\"reese-witherspoon-oscars-2013\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/reese-witherspoon-oscars-2013.jpg?w=500&h=709\" height=\"709\" width=\"500\"></a></p>\n<p>I can’t begin to tell you how much I dislike this look on Reese Witherspoon who opted for a royal blue strapless gown by  Louis Vuitton. I know, I know, she just had a baby I have to be nice but this is not about her weight, this is about styling the right kind of dress on the right body and this look does not work for her one bit.  She’s too short for such a long dress, she needs major support in the bodice and you know what royal blue is just not her color. Let alone that cliche hairdo.. One of my worst looks of the night</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kristen-stewart-oscars-20132.jpg\"><img alt=\"kristen-stewart-oscars-20132\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kristen-stewart-oscars-20132.jpg?w=500&h=750\" height=\"750\" width=\"500\"></a></p>\n<p>Look at that gorgeous off-white number by Reem Acra. Isn’t it beautiful? You can’t really tell can you? You know why? Because Kristen Stewart wore it with that face on. The girl is beautiful but she’s has to stop being such a slouch. Don’t tell me she was on crutches, that didn’t stop her from walking the red carpet but it sure stopped her from brushing her hair. You know how many women would kill to be in her shoes( Jimmy Choo) homegirl needs to practice some posture and smile!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jennifer-aniston.jpg\"><img alt=\"Jennifer Aniston\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/jennifer-aniston.jpg?w=500\"></a></p>\n<p>Doesn’t she seem so uncomfortable? I know Jennifer Aniston changed things up this time around and I appreciate the effort but she’s not wearing this crimson ball-gownish  Valentino, it’s totally wearing her. She further disappointing with that every-day hairstyle. If she was gonna give us something different why not go all the way. Maybe a little less fabric and a little more waist but sadly she lands on my worst dressed list.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/salma-hayek-oscars-2013.jpg\"><img alt=\"salma-hayek-oscars-2013\" src=\"http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/salma-hayek-oscars-2013.jpg?w=500&h=755\" height=\"755\" width=\"500\"></a></p>\n<p>I just saw her in that movie The Savages being all vicious but Salma Hayek looked every inch the Hollywood diva in this dress with   showstopping heavily embroidered neckline by Alexander McQueen. Not to mention how flawless and original her hair was. Time to give her stylist that raise she deserves!</p>\n<p>Also see:</p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://ivysays.com/2013/01/14/the-best-and-worst-dressed-on-the-2013-golden-globes-red-carpet/\">The Best and Worst Dressed on the 2013 Golden Globes Red Carpet</a></h1>\n<div></div>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ivysays.wordpress.com/5144/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ivysays.wordpress.com/5144/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ivysays.com&blog=11241585&post=5144&subd=ivysays&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">'),

Before that, here’s how the selection process will occur:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Stage 1: Online Nominations</strong><br>\nMembers of the online community nominate candidates for different categories via our website www.SMABeirut.com. Users can nominate themselves, friends or an organization on business based on the criteria of each category. Their submission is accompanied by relevant material such as Facebook links, Twitter accounts, blogs and other platforms to support their candidates.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2: Judges Selection</strong><br>\nBased on the nominations received, our team of experienced and celebrity judges from different backgrounds will be narrowing down the nominations in each category to seven (7) nominees within two weeks of closure of nominations. The whole process will be carried out in pure transparency and an announcement event will be held for the press and online community.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3: Final Vote</strong><br>\nMembers of the online community are asked to vote for their preference in each category over a period of one month. During this period, nominees will be able to campaign for obtaining votes.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4: Awards Ceremony</strong><br>\nAn awards ceremony will be held for over 750 invitees from digital agencies, VIPs and online influencers with entertainment, key guest appearances, and VIP guests bringing Oscar-like award glamour to social media. [<a href=\"http://www.smabeirut.com/\">SMABeirut</a>]</p></blockquote>\n<p>I took a look at the judges’ list and the ones they chose are more than qualified for this job, with 1 or 2 exceptions which I will not name. One thing that I would have done differently is narrow down the nominations to 4, as I think 7 is too much.</p>\n<p>Anyway back to the nominations, here it goes:</p>\n<p><strong>Best Blog of the Year</strong><br><a href=\"http://beirutspring.com/blog/\">Beirut Spring</a>: I’ve always been astounded by the insights Mustapha provides on the Lebanese society and Lebanon in general despite being abroad. He is concise, convincing, methodical and is among the very few bloggers that I agree with almost always. Oh and he never misses a chance to throw in a new term in every post and make me look for it online.</p>\n<p><strong>Best News Blog</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.hummusnation.net/\">Hummus Nation</a> – The good thing about Hummus Nation is that his news are always reliable because he makes them up.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Lifestyle Blog</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.larmoiredelana.com/\">L’armoire De Lana</a> – Lana has been pulling an impressive job ever since she launched her fashion blog. She’s posting daily, tweeting all day long, uploading pictures all the time. She’s doing it right and she totally deserves it.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Technology Blog</strong><br><a href=\"http://tech-ticker.com/\">Tech-Ticker</a> – A website founded by a group of Lebanese Technology enthusiasts covering the latest tech news and reviewing the most recent tech products.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Personal Blog</strong><br><a href=\"http://ginosblog.com/\">Gino’s Blog</a> – Gino is truly commited to his blog and it shows through his posts. His views on certain topics are as far as they come from the conservative “Lebanese” thinking yet he manages to convince his readers most of the time. Neuromarketing at its best. </p>\n<p><strong>Most Engaging Media Personality</strong><br><strong>Magazine:</strong> RagMag’s Editor in Chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fidachaaban\">Fida Chaaban</a>.<br>\nShe devotes a lot of times to social media and interacting with readers and that’s not something easy to pull.

His family is one of the country’s largest Shiite clans, and their business is kidnapping.</p>\n<p>“Of course I don’t want to do this,” Ibrahim said of his new part-time job driving for his cousins, both professional kidnappers. “But [the victims] are never harmed and I have to feed my family.”</p>\n<p>Kidnapping for ransom is one of the few forms of economic activity to flourish here as the civil war in neighboring Syria cripples the tourism industry and erodes the authority of the state.</p>\n<p>Last week a 12-year-old boy became the latest victim.</p>\n<p>In broad daylight gunmen snatched the child, the son of a prominent businessman, as he waited for a ride to school in an upscale Beirut neighborhood. He was released five days later, after the family paid a reported ransom of $250,000. Dozens of Lebanese businessmen have been taken and held for ransom over the past year.

Actually, I would have posted about it right away but I was waiting to get some decent pictures first and to do that I needed a friend’s help. (Thanks, <a href=\"http://candidstreet.me/\">Imad</a>!)</p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2197-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8524441411/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2197-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8524441411_65336e0481_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"640\"></a></p>\n<p>Making a coat is a huge undertaking and it’s kind of baffling, even to me, that this was pretty much the second garment I ever made. (Well, started. In the process of making it I completed quite a few others.) It goes without saying that I could not have done this all on my own as a first project, but luckily I had <a href=\"http://theoldfashionedway.blogspot.com/\">Layla</a> to help me in her coat making class.</p>\n<p>I started with an <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/lindsay_nyc/sewing-my-own-winter-coat/\">inspiration board</a> on Pinterest and then decided on this pattern from Simplicity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.simplicity.com/p-6161-misses-jackets.aspx\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.simplicity.com/images/product/medium/2149.jpg\" width=\"306\" height=\"439\"></a></p>\n<p>What I loved about the main image was the contrasting lines on the raglan sleeves and that it didn’t have a collar since that was one style of coat that I didn’t already own. The pattern didn’t come with a lining pattern so Layla had to help me figure that out, and I won’t lie and say it didn’t cause any trouble along the way!</p>\n<p>I bought the fabric for the coat on October 27, so that gives you an idea of how long it took. (We worked one night per week and then I took two weeks off for Christmas break).</p>\n<p>Apart from adding a lining, I changed several things on the coat. I changed the cuff on the sleeve and made a different type of pocket (both drafted myself), added piping where I think the pattern called for some type of sewn-on lace or rick rack), added a back stay, and added a panel behind where the eye hooks clasped. Needless to say, I learned a TON on this project!</p>\n<p>One thing I wish I had known before I started this project was how much the fabric was going to fray over the course of making the coat because that caused me a ton of headache. By either interfacing certain parts or using a stay stitch, or even adding some length to the sleeves and coat itself, I could have made my life a lot easier. I’ll know for next time!</p>\n<p>Here are some more pictures of the coat!</p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2199-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8524440459/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2199-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8524440459_d18a33d52f_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"640\"></a><em>The back</em></p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2207-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525552758/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2207-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8525552758_7cda69a71e_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"></a><br><em>The shoulders</em></p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2204-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525553738/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2204-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8525553738_c965575e8a_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"640\"></a>The lining, cuffs, and eye hook panel</p>\n<p>Saturday I took my coat out for a photo walk around Mar Mikhael and was joined by my friend Imad who took the pictures of me in the coat.</p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2210-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525551766/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2210-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8095/8525551766_61a9f32849_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"640\"></a><em>The coat in action on the streets of Beirut!</em></p>\n<p>And some of the shots from my afternoon in Mar Mikhael.</p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2190-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525556198/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2190-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8525556198_f548e4da62_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"></a></p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2186-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525556976/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2186-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8525556976_6ec53b1022_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"640\"></a></p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2212-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525550730/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2212-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8525550730_509a99b37f_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"></a></p>\n<p><a title=\"20130302-_MG_2182-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8524443819/\"><img alt=\"20130302-_MG_2182-untitled\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8524443819_c358ec8fa2_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"640\"></a></p>\n<p>If I make a coat again I’d like to try the <a href=\"http://www.sewaholicpatterns.com/product/1103-minoru-jacket\">Minoru</a> from Sewaholic because I don’t actually have a casual jacket and I’ve seen some really cute versions of this pattern.</p>\n<p>Have any of you sewists out there made a coat yet?

Usually, it’s Islamist fundamentalist filth about something they’re pissed off at. The other day though, I got one which caught my attention. First, because it wasn’t by a stupid bot or fundie (same thing really, the bot won’t kill you though, so that’s a plus).</p>\n<p>It was an “ad” for selling Facebook likes for your page, for as little as 60$ for 1000 likes. They vary from purely Lebanese, to Arab and worldwide “accounts”.</p>\n<p>I wonder sometimes how a page with 200 something likes skyrockets to 12,000 overnight. I mean, I’d understand if there was a competition running or something epic posted and shared on that page, but come on, out of the blue? Of course, many pages actually get those likes legitimately, through interacting with their fans, Facebook ads and most importantly, <em>good content.</em> Some though, are probably customers of this new “agency”.</p>\n<p>What’s cool is that Facebook caught on to the fake account likes, and removed them (remember when many FB pages in Lebanon dropped to like half their original likes number?)

But it’s less consequential than it likes to believe.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://freearabs.com/\"><img src=\"http://beirutspring.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/free-arabs-screenshot.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>It didn’t take long after <em><a href=\"http://freearabs.com/\">Free Arabs</a></em> launched for the critics to pounce: It wasn’t “authentic” enough. It’s too “westernised”. It’s a plot by “zionist normalisers” and atheists. The whole nine yards of a classic Arab tradition in intellectual bullying, where leftists bash their opponents as “zionists” and islamists bash their opponents as “atheists”, denying them recognition and legitimacy. </p>\n<p>The reality is that there are many Arabs out there who really believe in what the west calls “universal values”: Freedom of thought, freedom from oppression, freedom of religious belief, minority rights..etc. They are looking with horror at how the promise of the Arab Spring is transforming into a winter of non-inclusive Islamists and close-minded demagogues. The “Free Arabs” website is the result of these people pooling their efforts together in response. Some of the people working really hard on that website are acquaintances and friends of mine.</p>\n<h2>The two faces of the West</h2>\n<p>At the heart of the criticism of projects like <em>Free Arabs</em> is a potent and classic deceptive trick that deliberately confounds two aspects of the “West”. The first is that of the West as a collection of old colonial powers and polities that seek to advance their economic interests today. The second is the West as a birthplace of ideas like individual rights, freedom of expression and civil rights through historical movements like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment\">age of enlightenment</a>, the french revolution and the American civil rights movement.</p>\n<p>When activists in Egypt call for “freedom” and people in Lebanon demand civil marriage, their opponents immediately accuse them of bringing “western ideas” to their societies, <em>“the same west that invaded Iraq, divided the Arab world and supported Israel”</em>. One of the <em>Free Arabs’</em> greatest challenges in the medium and long run is to decouple these two aspects of the west in people’s minds (and from their own minds)</p>\n<h2>“Westernised Elites”</h2>\n<p><em>Free Arabs</em> are comfortable with the idea that they’re “westernised”. In their minds that doesn’t make them any less “Arab” because they associate the west with the collection of emancipative ideals mentioned above. They blast “hypocrites” who accuse them of being westernised while driving western cars, wearing western cloths and listening to western music. They are confortable in writing in french and english, and they don’t mind employing western forms of communication like straight-faced satire and <a href=\"http://freearabs.com/index.php/society/81-stories/242-jb-span-jb-span\">intimate vlogging</a>.</p>\n<p>What they don’t like being called however is “Elites”. That’s because they believe in their hearts that the poor and helpless benefit from their ideas more than the rich. An empowered and free individual can hold her leaders accountable for their actions, unlike those who follow religious leaders and dictators. This, in my opinion is where the shortcomings of <em>Free Arabs</em> begin to appear.</p>\n<h2>Talk shop</h2>\n<p><em>Free Arabs</em>, with their irreverent critiques of religious figures and cavalier dismissal of social norms are still out of the mainstream in many Arab and Muslim countries. The website is more likely to end up as a place for discussion (and fun) of like-minded people than one that influences the nature of the region. Discussions and open debate are good things, but we may have to live with the reality that conservative populations will never listen to people like us.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:J3aVl1i_38o\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=J3aVl1i_38o\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/beirutspring/fb_feed/~4/ro4HIFejq1o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">'),

Once this story is chosen, a specially personalized record will be created for that person! Too cheesy? Not really, I really thought the songs were pretty funny. I mean any girl would fall for a song, so why not a silly love song?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I think it’s a cool and humorous initiative for a Valentines campaign, I mean, if you suck at singing and its too late to buy gifts, just wait for your story to be chosen and send that cheap youtube link to your lover. But where does AXE relate in this whole campaign? Shouldnt they have created a special Valentines deodorant or something? AXE has always been about you-smell-so-good-i-want-you-now and I honestly think this should have been introduced in their campaign. I mean its VALENTINES! This is where it should happen! I don’t want a cheesy love song about a story where we met or whatever. Show me something more creative and I, as a loyal lover, will tell you to buy AXE deodorant for the whole month of February. I mean isnt that the point of campaigns?</div>\n<div>I hope AXE will “izabbatouha” next Valentines, especially on the level of art direction.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>More info:</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div><span><span><b>Insights:<br></b></span></span><span><span>Women love Valentine’s Day, and for guys it’s an opportunity to prove to that special someone that they love her… or still love her.\n<p></p></span></span><span><span><b>The Problem:<br></b></span></span><span><span>While some men don’t even bother trying, others are busy planning out the actual date; the attire, the gifts, the place, that they forget one of the most crucial things: popping the Valentine’s question: </span></span><span><span>Will you be my Valentine?</span></span><span><span>\n<p></p></span></span><span><span><b>The Solution:<br></b></span></span><span><span>We believe that if the man asks her out in an unforgettable way, his chances of her saying yes are higher.

The more the body is conceptualized as “shameful” in public consciousness, the least effort it takes to make it an expression of protest. The struggle of women, whether in the setting of feminist groups or as a part of wide national movements is going in the direction of enabling the body to express, both as a mean of liberalization and a mean of protest. In a strict religious and patriarchal country  the mere presence of a fully covered female body in public can be an event, while this same body has to perform something more expressive to draw attention in a more liberal society.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>Saudi Sit-in</p>\n<p>The Saudi women who gathered in Buraydah last week to protest against the political imprisonment of their family members were themselves arrested before they spend their second night in an open air sit in. It was reported that they were forced into a bus and transferred to a police station where they were subject to rude questioning… Regardless of the backgrounds of this female protest the event itself is highly significant in a country where a woman is not allowed to show up on a street without the company of a supervising male relative. The mere presence of these women in the street, the presence of their bodies, though totally covered, in what authorities consider to be the wrong place, was so loud a protest that the ruling system had to react in a violent manner. Their sit in was not only regarded as a political protest but as a threat to break the authority of the patriarchal system.</p>\n<p>Lebanese Dance Protest</p>\n<p>In a more liberal country, though enough patriarchal, a female sit in wouldn’t be an exceptional event. Lebanese activists understand that additional efforts have to be made to render the body a more expressive tool. Last Sunday, in the demonstration organized by  the NGO <a href=\"http://www.kafa.org.lb/\">KAFA</a> demanding a law to protect women from domestic violence, a group of women performed a dance in front of the residency of the speaker of Lebanese parliament. Although the Lebanese political elite is deaf enough to ignore even much bigger protests, the event did not pass unnoticed. Midst the political and economic crisis through which the country is passing, both conventional and social media echoed the demands of women to have a protecting law.</p>\n<p>The implementation of the human body in protests around the Arab world, whether the body is still or in motion, covered or nude , reflects an increasing awareness of the power the corporal existence as a loud “NO”. However, the way this body is used will always vary in a way to suite each society and its mentality.</p>\n<p>———————–</p>\n<p><a name=\"Arabic\"></a></p>\n<h2>الأجساد النسائية المعترضة في السكون والحركة</h2>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">إن التهميش المزمن الذي عاناه الجسد الإنساني عموماً وجسد المرأة بشكل خاص، ومفهوم العيب المسقط على حرية الجسد في التعبير، يجعلان من هذه الأجساد سلاح اعتراض حاد. وكلما زاد ارتباط مفهوم الجسد في الوعي العام بالعيب تضاءلت الحاجة إلى مجهود إضافي يحول الجسد إلى تعبير عن الرفض والاعتراض.</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">إن نضال النساء سواء في المجموعات النسوية أو ضمن حراك وطني عام، يتجه نحو تمكين الجسد من التعبير كوسيلة للاعتراض والتحرير في آن معاً. في الدول الدينية البطريركية يعتبر وجود الجسد النسائي في الفضاء العام، حتى ولو كان الجسد مغطى، حدثاً بحد ذاته. بينما يجب على هذا الجسد نفسه أن يقوم بأداء تعبيري أكبر لجذب الانتباه في مجتمع أكثر ليبرالية.</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">الاعتصام السعودي</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">النساء السعوديات اللواتي تجمعن في البريدة الأسبوع الماضي احتجاجاً على سجن أفراد من عائلاتهن تعرضن هن أنفسهن للاعتقال قبل أن تمضين ليلتهن الثانية في اعتصام نفذنه في الهواء الطلق. ذكرت التقارير أن النساء أجبرن على ركوب حافلة نقلتهن إلى مركز للشرطة حيث تعرضن لتحقيق قاس… بغض النظر عن الخلفيات السياسية للاعتراض فإن الحدث بحد ذاته ذو دلالة كبيرة في بلد لا يسمح للنساء بالخروج من البيت إلا بمرافقة وليّ. إن وجود هؤلاء النسوة في الشارع، وجود أجسادهن ولو كاسية، في مكان تعتبره السلطات المكان غير صحيح لوجود هذه الأجساد، كان احتجاجاً صارخاً ولولا ذاك لما كانت ردة فعل السلطة عنيفة إلى هذا الحد. فاعتصامهن لم يعتبر فقط احتجاجاً سياسياً بل تهديداً بكسر سلطة المنظومة البطريركية.</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">الرقص احتجاجاً في لبنان</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">في بلد أكثر ليبرالية، وإن كان بطريركياً إلى حد كبير، ما كان الاعتصام النسائي ليعتبر حدثاً استثنائياً. كان واضحاً للناشطات اللبنانيات أن مجهوداً إضافية يجب أن يبذل ليكتسب الجسد المزيد من قوة التعبير. الأحد الماضي (24 شباط 2013) قام مجموعة من النساء بتأدية رقصة قرب منزل رئيس مجلس النواب أثناء مسيرة مطالبة بإقرار قانون حماية النساء من العنف الأسري. وبالرغم من صمم الطبقة السياسية اللبنانية عن احتجاجات أكبر حجماً، إلا أن مسيرة النساء لم تمرّ غير ملاحَظَة. فوسط الأزمة السياسية والاقتصادية التي تعاني منها البلاد لاقت مطالب النساء باعتماد قانون يحميهن صدى في وسائل الإعلام التقليدي والوسائل الالكترونية للتواصل الاجتماعي.</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">إن اسخدام الجسد سواء كان ساكناً أو متحركاً، عارياً أو كاسياً، كوسيلة احتجاج في مناطق عربية شتى يدل على ازدياد الوعي بقوة الوجود الجسدي كاحتجاج صارخ. علماً أن شكل الاعتراض يختلف بين بلد وآخر بحيث يناسب كل مجتمع وعقليته.</p></div>'),

I happen to think that this has been a very ineffective\ncabinet and that the time for a change is way overdue. But one should not\nexpect a cabinet to resign only because the opposition says so during press\nconferences only. There is a legitimate parliamentary procedure to be followed\nif and when any of the 128 members of the Chamber wishes to call for vote of\nconfidence in the cabinet as a whole. March 14, unfortunately has chosen not to\nfollow that path but instead to use the press to release statements that are\nneither effective nor meaningful. </span></div>\n<div>\n<br></div>\n<div>\n<span>If Mr.\nSaniora wants us to really believe that he is the reasonable leader of a large\nbloc of representatives in the Chamber then the least he could do is challenge\nthe cabinet in a vote of confidence, even one that his group cannot win. It is\nthe nature of these challenges that will keep the cabinet as a whole and each\nof its individual members sensitive to the demands and needs of the others in\nthe state. The same logic, obviously, would demand nothing less than that by\nMr. Geagea and his Lebanese Forces if they are truly dissatisfied with the\npolicies and the programs of the present cabinet. As for Sa’ad Hariri, I am\nafraid that he has given up the right to either head a new cabinet or even lead\na major bloc. Someone should remind Mr. Hariri that he got his chance and his\nperformance was and still is way below par. It is time for him to recognize\nthat politics is not his forte neither is leadership.</span></div>\n<div>\n<br></div>\n<div>\n<span>None of the\nabove is to be interpreted as an endorsement of Mr. Mikati who had a chance to\nrepeat his previous performance as a PM but instead decided to play second\nfiddle to Michel Aoun, Hassan Nasrallah and to act at times as if he is working\nfor Damascus. </span></div>\n<div>\n<br></div>\n<div>\n<span>A democracy,\neven a shallow one, is expected to at least be able to implement the major\nconstitutional declarations as prescribed by law. This means that nothing,\nabsolutely nothing, can justify not holding elections at the date specified by\nlaw.<span>  </span>One of the most sacrosanct\nprinciples in the rule of law is to abide by the details of the law as\nprescribed. These major institutional decisions are not to be handled casually\nby changing them whenever one desires. Laws are to be respected and it is the\nduty of governments, to take the constitutional responsibility very seriously.\nUnfortunately very few, if any, in the present cadre of Lebanese politicians\nseems to be up to this major task.</span></div>\n<div>\n<br></div>\n<div>\n<span>The Chamber\nis clearly forbidden from electing to the Presidency an ex Chief of the Army\nbut yet that was exactly what they did without even questioning the\nunconstitutionality of their act. As if that is not enough, they have failed\nfor twenty years to elect a Senate and to deconfesionalize the Chamber as well\nas all positions in the government. Add to the above the fact that the central\ngovernment does not dare exercise its power in certain regions of the country\nnor over some groups. It is not only that they tolerate the challenge to the\ngovernment authority but they even encourage it through their inability to\ntreat all regions and all citizens as equal. <span> </span>The above are only the tip of the iceberg: This\ncabinet as well as its predecessors have failed to combat corruption that has\nbecome endemic, have neglected to construct a reliable electric grid in a self\ndescribed tourist state and have dared to introduce economic legislation and practices\nthat defy any and all teachings of any school of thought in the field. And\nfinally the cabinets for the past twenty years have acted as if the national\nsovereign debt challenge does not exist; they hope that the probability of a\npotential offshore gas find is going to resolve this issue. That is so\nirresponsible that it reminds me of the Greek tragedies whose plot builds up to\na level that is impossible to solve until a dues ex machina appears. (A\nheavenly solution</span><span><span>:-)</span></span><span>). </span></div>\n<div>\n<br></div>\n<div>\n<span>The Lebanese\npoliticians have had so many opportunities to prove their allegiance to the\ncountry, to democracy and to law and order. Unfortunately they have failed\npractically every single time. I hope that they hold elections on time without\nany resort to such gimmicks as extensions. If they fail this time then it might\nbe one time too many. </span></div>');
