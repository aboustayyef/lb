Actually, I would have posted about it right away but I was waiting to get some decent pictures first and to do that I needed a friend’s help. (Thanks, <a href="http://candidstreet.me/">Imad</a>!)</p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2197-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8524441411/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2197-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8524441411_65336e0481_z.jpg" width="427" height="640"></a></p>\n<p>Making a coat is a huge undertaking and it’s kind of baffling, even to me, that this was pretty much the second garment I ever made. (Well, started. In the process of making it I completed quite a few others.) It goes without saying that I could not have done this all on my own as a first project, but luckily I had <a href="http://theoldfashionedway.blogspot.com/">Layla</a> to help me in her coat making class.</p>\n<p>I started with an <a href="http://pinterest.com/lindsay_nyc/sewing-my-own-winter-coat/">inspiration board</a> on Pinterest and then decided on this pattern from Simplicity.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.simplicity.com/p-6161-misses-jackets.aspx"><img alt="" src="http://www.simplicity.com/images/product/medium/2149.jpg" width="306" height="439"></a></p>\n<p>What I loved about the main image was the contrasting lines on the raglan sleeves and that it didn’t have a collar since that was one style of coat that I didn’t already own. The pattern didn’t come with a lining pattern so Layla had to help me figure that out, and I won’t lie and say it didn’t cause any trouble along the way!</p>\n<p>I bought the fabric for the coat on October 27, so that gives you an idea of how long it took. (We worked one night per week and then I took two weeks off for Christmas break).</p>\n<p>Apart from adding a lining, I changed several things on the coat. I changed the cuff on the sleeve and made a different type of pocket (both drafted myself), added piping where I think the pattern called for some type of sewn-on lace or rick rack), added a back stay, and added a panel behind where the eye hooks clasped. Needless to say, I learned a TON on this project!</p>\n<p>One thing I wish I had known before I started this project was how much the fabric was going to fray over the course of making the coat because that caused me a ton of headache. By either interfacing certain parts or using a stay stitch, or even adding some length to the sleeves and coat itself, I could have made my life a lot easier. I’ll know for next time!</p>\n<p>Here are some more pictures of the coat!</p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2199-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8524440459/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2199-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8524440459_d18a33d52f_z.jpg" width="427" height="640"></a><em>The back</em></p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2207-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525552758/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2207-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8525552758_7cda69a71e_z.jpg" width="640" height="427"></a><br><em>The shoulders</em></p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2204-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525553738/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2204-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8525553738_c965575e8a_z.jpg" width="427" height="640"></a>The lining, cuffs, and eye hook panel</p>\n<p>Saturday I took my coat out for a photo walk around Mar Mikhael and was joined by my friend Imad who took the pictures of me in the coat.</p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2210-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525551766/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2210-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8095/8525551766_61a9f32849_z.jpg" width="427" height="640"></a><em>The coat in action on the streets of Beirut!</em></p>\n<p>And some of the shots from my afternoon in Mar Mikhael.</p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2190-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525556198/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2190-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8525556198_f548e4da62_z.jpg" width="640" height="427"></a></p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2186-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525556976/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2186-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8525556976_6ec53b1022_z.jpg" width="427" height="640"></a></p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2212-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8525550730/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2212-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8525550730_509a99b37f_z.jpg" width="640" height="427"></a></p>\n<p><a title="20130302-_MG_2182-untitled by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8524443819/"><img alt="20130302-_MG_2182-untitled" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8524443819_c358ec8fa2_z.jpg" width="427" height="640"></a></p>\n<p>If I make a coat again I’d like to try the <a href="http://www.sewaholicpatterns.com/product/1103-minoru-jacket">Minoru</a> from Sewaholic because I don’t actually have a casual jacket and I’ve seen some really cute versions of this pattern.</p>\n<p>Have any of you sewists out there made a coat yet?

Of course, many pages actually get those likes legitimately, through interacting with their fans, Facebook ads and most importantly, <em>good content.</em> Some though, are probably customers of this new “agency”.</p>\n<p>What’s cool is that Facebook caught on to the fake account likes, and removed them (remember when many FB pages in Lebanon dropped to like half their original likes number?)

But it’s less consequential than it likes to believe.</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://freearabs.com/"><img alt="" src="http://beirutspring.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/free-arabs-screenshot.jpg"></a></p>\n<p>It didn’t take long after <em><a href="http://freearabs.com/">Free Arabs</a></em> launched for the critics to pounce: It wasn’t “authentic” enough. It is too “westernised”. It’s a plot by “zionist normalisers” and atheists. The whole nine yards of a classic Arab tradition in intellectual bullying, where leftists bash their opponents as “zionists” and islamists bash their opponents as “atheists”, denying them recognition and legitimacy.</p>\n<p>The reality is that there are many Arabs out there who really believe in what the west calls “universal values”: Freedom of thought, freedom from oppression, freedom of religious belief, minority rights..etc. They are looking with horror at how the promise of the Arab Spring is turning into a winter of non-inclusive Islamists and close-minded demagogues. The “Free Arabs” website is the result of these people pooling their efforts together in response. Some of the people working really hard on that website are acquaintances and friends of mine.</p>\n<h2>The two faces of the West</h2>\n<p>At the heart of the criticism of projects like <em>Free Arabs</em> is a potent and classic deceptive trick that deliberately confounds two aspects of the “West”. The first is that of the West as a collection of old colonial powers and polities that seek to advance their economic interests today. The second is the West as a birthplace of ideas like individual rights, freedom of expression and civil rights through historical movements like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">age of enlightenment</a>, the french revolution and the American civil rights movement.</p>\n<p>When activists in Egypt call for “freedom” and people in Lebanon demand civil marriage, their opponents immediately accuse them of bringing “western ideas” to their societies, <em>“the same west that invaded Iraq, divided the Arab world and supported Israel”</em>. One of the <em>Free Arabs’</em> greatest challenges in the medium and long run is to decouple these two aspects of the west in people’s minds (and from their own minds)</p>\n<h2>“Westernised Elites”</h2>\n<p><em>Free Arabs</em> are comfortable with the idea that they’re “westernised”. In their minds that doesn’t make them any less “Arab” because they associate the west with the collection of emancipative ideals mentioned above. They blast “hypocrites” who accuse them of being westernised while driving western cars, wearing western cloths and listening to western music. They are comfortable with writing in french and english, and they don’t mind employing western forms of communication like straight-faced satire and <a href="http://freearabs.com/index.php/society/81-stories/242-jb-span-jb-span">intimate vlogging</a>.</p>\n<p>What they don’t like being called however is “Elites”. That’s because they believe in their hearts that the poor and helpless benefit from their ideas more than the rich. An empowered and free individual can hold her leaders accountable for their actions, unlike those who follow religious leaders and dictators. This, in my opinion is where the shortcomings of <em>Free Arabs</em> begin to appear.</p>\n<h2>Talk shop</h2>\n<p><em>Free Arabs</em>, with their irreverent critiques of religious figures and cavalier dismissal of social norms are still out of the mainstream in many Arab and Muslim countries. The website is more likely to end up as a place for discussion (and fun) of like-minded people than one that influences the nature of the region. Discussions and open debate are good things, but we may have to live with the reality that conservative populations will never listen to people like us.</p>\n<div>\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:D7DqB2pKExk"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:D7DqB2pKExk" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=ro4HIFejq1o:gFAj49FO5_w:J3aVl1i_38o"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=J3aVl1i_38o" border="0"></a>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/beirutspring/fb_feed/~4/ro4HIFejq1o" height="1" width="1">\n'),

Once this story is chosen, a specially personalized record will be created for that person! Too cheesy? Not really, I really thought the songs were pretty funny. I mean any girl would fall for a song, so why not a silly love song?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I think it’s a cool and humorous initiative for a Valentines campaign, I mean, if you suck at singing and its too late to buy gifts, just wait for your story to be chosen and send that cheap youtube link to your lover. But where does AXE relate in this whole campaign? Shouldnt they have created a special Valentines deodorant or something? AXE has always been about you-smell-so-good-i-want-you-now and I honestly think this should have been introduced in their campaign. I mean its VALENTINES! This is where it should happen! I don’t want a cheesy love song about a story where we met or whatever. Show me something more creative and I, as a loyal lover, will tell you to buy AXE deodorant for the whole month of February.

The more the body is conceptualized as “shameful” in public consciousness, the least effort it takes to make it an expression of protest. The struggle of women, whether in the setting of feminist groups or as a part of wide national movements is going in the direction of enabling the body to express, both as a mean of liberalization and a mean of protest. In a strict religious and patriarchal country  the mere presence of a fully covered female body in public can be an event, while this same body has to perform something more expressive to draw attention in a more liberal society.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>Saudi Sit-in</p>\n<p>The Saudi women who gathered in Buraydah last week to protest against the political imprisonment of their family members were themselves arrested before they spend their second night in an open air sit in. It was reported that they were forced into a bus and transferred to a police station where they were subject to rude questioning… Regardless of the backgrounds of this female protest the event itself is highly significant in a country where a woman is not allowed to show up on a street without the company of a supervising male relative. The mere presence of these women in the street, the presence of their bodies, though totally covered, in what authorities consider to be the wrong place, was so loud a protest that the ruling system had to react in a violent manner. Their sit in was not only regarded as a political protest but as a threat to break the authority of the patriarchal system.</p>\n<p>Lebanese Dance Protest</p>\n<p>In a more liberal country, though enough patriarchal, a female sit in wouldn’t be an exceptional event. Lebanese activists understand that additional efforts have to be made to render the body a more expressive tool. Last Sunday, in the demonstration organized by  the NGO <a href="http://www.kafa.org.lb/">KAFA</a> demanding a law to protect women from domestic violence, a group of women performed a dance in front of the residency of the speaker of Lebanese parliament. Although the Lebanese political elite is deaf enough to ignore even much bigger protests, the event did not pass unnoticed. Midst the political and economic crisis through which the country is passing, both conventional and social media echoed the demands of women to have a protecting law.</p>\n<p>The implementation of the human body in protests around the Arab world, whether the body is still or in motion, covered or nude , reflects an increasing awareness of the power the corporal existence as a loud “NO”. However, the way this body is used will always vary in a way to suite each society and its mentality.</p>\n<p>———————–</p>\n<p><a name="Arabic"></a></p>\n<h2>الأجساد النسائية المعترضة في السكون والحركة</h2>\n<p dir="rtl">إن التهميش المزمن الذي عاناه الجسد الإنساني عموماً وجسد المرأة بشكل خاص، ومفهوم العيب المسقط على حرية الجسد في التعبير، يجعلان من هذه الأجساد سلاح اعتراض حاد. وكلما زاد ارتباط مفهوم الجسد في الوعي العام بالعيب تضاءلت الحاجة إلى مجهود إضافي يحول الجسد إلى تعبير عن الرفض والاعتراض.</p>\n<p dir="rtl">إن نضال النساء سواء في المجموعات النسوية أو ضمن حراك وطني عام، يتجه نحو تمكين الجسد من التعبير كوسيلة للاعتراض والتحرير في آن معاً. في الدول الدينية البطريركية يعتبر وجود الجسد النسائي في الفضاء العام، حتى ولو كان الجسد مغطى، حدثاً بحد ذاته. بينما يجب على هذا الجسد نفسه أن يقوم بأداء تعبيري أكبر لجذب الانتباه في مجتمع أكثر ليبرالية.</p>\n<p dir="rtl">الاعتصام السعودي</p>\n<p dir="rtl">النساء السعوديات اللواتي تجمعن في البريدة الأسبوع الماضي احتجاجاً على سجن أفراد من عائلاتهن تعرضن هن أنفسهن للاعتقال قبل أن تمضين ليلتهن الثانية في اعتصام نفذنه في الهواء الطلق. ذكرت التقارير أن النساء أجبرن على ركوب حافلة نقلتهن إلى مركز للشرطة حيث تعرضن لتحقيق قاس… بغض النظر عن الخلفيات السياسية للاعتراض فإن الحدث بحد ذاته ذو دلالة كبيرة في بلد لا يسمح للنساء بالخروج من البيت إلا بمرافقة وليّ. إن وجود هؤلاء النسوة في الشارع، وجود أجسادهن ولو كاسية، في مكان تعتبره السلطات المكان غير صحيح لوجود هذه الأجساد، كان احتجاجاً صارخاً ولولا ذاك لما كانت ردة فعل السلطة عنيفة إلى هذا الحد. فاعتصامهن لم يعتبر فقط احتجاجاً سياسياً بل تهديداً بكسر سلطة المنظومة البطريركية.</p>\n<p dir="rtl">الرقص احتجاجاً في لبنان</p>\n<p dir="rtl">في بلد أكثر ليبرالية، وإن كان بطريركياً إلى حد كبير، ما كان الاعتصام النسائي ليعتبر حدثاً استثنائياً. كان واضحاً للناشطات اللبنانيات أن مجهوداً إضافية يجب أن يبذل ليكتسب الجسد المزيد من قوة التعبير. الأحد الماضي (24 شباط 2013) قام مجموعة من النساء بتأدية رقصة قرب منزل رئيس مجلس النواب أثناء مسيرة مطالبة بإقرار قانون حماية النساء من العنف الأسري. وبالرغم من صمم الطبقة السياسية اللبنانية عن احتجاجات أكبر حجماً، إلا أن مسيرة النساء لم تمرّ غير ملاحَظَة. فوسط الأزمة السياسية والاقتصادية التي تعاني منها البلاد لاقت مطالب النساء باعتماد قانون يحميهن صدى في وسائل الإعلام التقليدي والوسائل الالكترونية للتواصل الاجتماعي.</p>\n<p dir="rtl">إن اسخدام الجسد سواء كان ساكناً أو متحركاً، عارياً أو كاسياً، كوسيلة احتجاج في مناطق عربية شتى يدل على ازدياد الوعي بقوة الوجود الجسدي كاحتجاج صارخ. علماً أن شكل الاعتراض يختلف بين بلد وآخر بحيث يناسب كل مجتمع وعقليته.</p>\n<br> Tagged: <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/body-protest/">Body Protest</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/buraydah-protest/">Buraydah Protest</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/dance-protest/">Dance Protest</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/domestic-violence/">Domestic Violence</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/kafa/">Kafa</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/lebanon/">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B9-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3/">مشروع قانون حماية النساء من العنف الأسري</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A7/">نساء يرقصن احتجاجا</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B3%D8%AF/">الاعتراض بالجسد</a>, <a href="http://qaph.wordpress.com/tag/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9/">البريدة</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/qaph.wordpress.com/404/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=qaph.wordpress.com&blog=41029563&post=404&subd=qaph&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n</div>'),

Before that, here’s how the selection process will occur:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Stage 1: Online Nominations</strong><br>\nMembers of the online community nominate candidates for different categories via our website www.SMABeirut.com. Users can nominate themselves, friends or an organization on business based on the criteria of each category. Their submission is accompanied by relevant material such as Facebook links, Twitter accounts, blogs and other platforms to support their candidates.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2: Judges Selection</strong><br>\nBased on the nominations received, our team of experienced and celebrity judges from different backgrounds will be narrowing down the nominations in each category to seven (7) nominees within two weeks of closure of nominations. The whole process will be carried out in pure transparency and an announcement event will be held for the press and online community.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3: Final Vote</strong><br>\nMembers of the online community are asked to vote for their preference in each category over a period of one month. During this period, nominees will be able to campaign for obtaining votes.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4: Awards Ceremony</strong><br>\nAn awards ceremony will be held for over 750 invitees from digital agencies, VIPs and online influencers with entertainment, key guest appearances, and VIP guests bringing Oscar-like award glamour to social media. [<a href="http://www.smabeirut.com/">SMABeirut</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I took a look at the judges’ list and the ones they chose are more than qualified for this job, with 1 or 2 exceptions which I will not name.

I was amazed by all the details around me, I took photos and talked with every member of the staff who again took photos of me. I really felt welcome and spoilt. I think this is the word: They spoil you there, with their food, their ambiance, their friendliness and – their generosity. Am I exaggerating? Pas du tout! Just try it out. The perfect place to hang out. </p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/category/cafes-restos/">CAFÉS & RESTOS</a> Tagged: <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/beirut/">Beirut</a>, <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/fashion/">Fashion</a>, <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/food/">Food</a>, <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/lebanon/">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/lifestyle-2/">Lifestyle</a>, <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/photography/">Photography</a>, <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/travel/">Travel</a>, <a href="http://meandbeirut.com/tag/women/">Women</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/meandbeirut.wordpress.com/2958/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=meandbeirut.com&blog=31277394&post=2958&subd=meandbeirut&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

In the past, the main champion of this idea has been Speaker Nabih Berri, but there has never been an occasion to take the possibility seriously since Lebanon’s electoral laws have generally not departed drastically from precedent. </span></p>\n<p>This year is different. We’ve seen the biggest political parties get behind some outlandish (dare I say unorthodox) schemes. The Christians support <a title="What to Read on Lebanon’s Proposed 2013 Electoral Law" href="http://qifanabki.com/2013/02/20/what-to-read-on-lebanons-proposed-2013-electoral-law/"><strong>a single-district formula</strong></a> that would forbid citizens from voting for anyone but a member of their own sect. The Sunni Future Movement has floated the idea of a <a title="Establishing a Lebanese Senate: Bicameralism and the Third Republic" href="http://qifanabki.com/2012/08/23/establishing-a-lebanese-senate-bicameralism-and-the-third-republic/"><strong>bicameral legislature</strong></a>. And the largest Shiite party has now put forward a “compromise” solution in the form of a single district with no forced confessional voting.</p>\n<p>It seems a safe bet that Hizbullah’s proposal is dead in the water. The Future Movement is unlikely to go for it because they’ll lose seats to Hizbullah under any large district proportional representation model, and the Christians won’t go for it because it maximizes the number of Christian MPs elected by non-Christian voters. What Nasrallah is proposing, in fact, is the exact opposite of what Aoun has proposed, which says something interesting about these two allies’ respective visions of the country.</p>\n<p>But even though the proposal is unlikely to go anywhere, I thought I’d present some observations on what a single national district model might engender. I am indebted to the wisdom of a very savvy expert who would prefer to remain anonymous.</p>\n<p><strong><span>1. What kind of proportional representation are we talking about? </span></strong></p>\n<p>As several commentators have snarkily remarked, it’s a little ironic that Nasrallah’s ideal electoral law resembles the system that exists in Israel (but also recently in Jordan and also in Palestine in 2006). In those contexts, the system used is called “<strong>Closed List PR</strong>,” which means that parties are responsible for ranking their own candidates on a list. Voters basically just go to the polls and cast a single vote for one of the various national lists that are running. Seats are allocated to the various lists in proportion to the votes won. The specific candidates that are chosen from the winning lists are determined by <em>the list’s own ranking of those candidates. </em></p>\n<p>In Lebanon, however, all proposals so far have been for “<strong>Open List PR</strong>,” where voters choose their favored  list but may also give a preferential vote to a specific candidate on that list. Seats are allocated to lists on a proportional basis, but seats are allocated to candidates in the order that they received preferential votes. <em>This approach gives the voters, not the party, the power to determine who wins a seat on a list.</em></p>\n<p>What’s the impact of this in practice? As my informant suggests:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are some technical aspects (imagine the size of a ballot paper for Open List for just 2 lists with 128 candidates each). But the major impact is on how parties prepare lists and campaign. For a Closed List, how do you get someone to agree to be 128th, , or even 40th on a list when there is an absolute certainty of not winning? Who would Aoun choose to be a number 2? This system requires a very different approach to party politics (one that is disciplined and/or democratic) that Lebanon lacks but for one major exception [i.e. Hizbullah]. It also means campaigns are funded by parties/heads of lists/members/donors and not by candidates themselves. Open List creates a different dynamic, as it often means that there’s an internal contest within the list (‘Vote for List A but for me, and not for him’). There’s also the problem of popular leaders, who may win the vast majority of the preferential voters cast on a list, which means that some of that list’s candidates may win a seat despite only winning very few preferential votes.</p>\n<p>The short answer is that Nasrallah probably supports Closed List PR but has not yet been distinct on the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Confessional Quotas</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>In order to maintain a system of confessional quotas within a single national district, you need a special methodology. First, each list would have to contain every confession that has a seat in proportion to the number of seats for each confession (i.e. you could not have a list with more than one Armenian Catholic). Second, there would need to be a mechanism to allocate seats so that it is not just done in terms of the rank order or preferential order, but where there is a rule that a candidate would be skipped if that confession was previously filled.</p>\n<p>In other words, it would be possible for a Greek Catholic candidate (for example) to be elected with fewer votes than a Maronite candidate <em>on the same list</em> if all the Maronite spots had already been filled by candidates who won even more votes than the guy who would be passed over by the Greek Catholic. I have a great diagram someplace that explains this…</p>\n<p>The problem is that in Lebanon there is also the constitutional requirement that the Parliament represent the country both confessionally and geographically, which has traditionally meant that each confessional seat is tied to a specific district. In other words, it’s not just 34 Maronite seats to be included as a quota but 1 Maronite from Akkar, 3 from Zghorta etc.</p>\n<p>Each PR proposal so far has maintained this connection which in effect creates a ‘double quota’, and that is incredibly hard to manage within PR lists for a single national district unless there are requirements for each list to have ‘A Maronite from Akkar’, ‘An Alawite from Akkar’, etc. It’s not clear if Nasrallah is envisaging that there would be such lists, or if he’d support scrapping the district connection altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Thresholds</strong></p>\n<p>The results of a PR system can be significantly impacted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold"><strong>election threshold</strong></a> adopted. The common wisdom is that a lower threshold makes it easier for non-mainstream candidates to get elected (which is often code for “liberals and radicals”). My informant clarifies:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You don’t need a threshold as PR always creates a natural threshold with the electoral quotient (e.g. in 2009, to win a seat: 1,734,029 voter turnout divided by 128 seats = 13,548 electoral quotient. It’s worth noting that Lady Geagea won a seat with just 13,066 in 2009.) But a threshold is useful to ensure that there are not too many small parties. Israel now has a 2% threshold above which a party qualifies for a seat. In 2009, that would have meant a list would need 34,680 to win a seat. That’s more than what Aoun got to win a seat in Kerswan.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Full Lists or Partial Lists?</strong></p>\n<p>One issue that always comes up in discussions of single national districts is whether one would have to field a full list in order to compete in the election. Obviously, putting together a list of 128 candidates is a very difficult thing to do for any organization that is not already a mainstream political party. This is why in many countries with single-district PR systems, you do not need to submit a full list. In Lebanon, however, the confessional quotas create complexities for allowing partial lists.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the issues that should be discussed in any national conversation about a single national district.</p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5333/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5333/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=qifanabki.com&blog=4404162&post=5333&subd=qifanabki&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n');

I’ve heard its called “toe cleavage” and now I hate it even more. Besides that, a thong extends from the base of the heel to the ankle- that’s going to cause pulling on the toes.

One (the chef) was from<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkar_District"> Akkar</a> in the North, another was from the South, etc. I asked them what kinds of foods they ate growing up. Each had completely different recollections; in fact, neither had ever <em>tasted</em> the foods that the other had experienced. (One even described homemade pasta with savory sauces called macaroons that is widespread in the country as a sweet donut!). <a href="http://www.ducksters.com/geography/country.php?country=Lebanon">Lebanon</a> is a tiny country (smaller than Connecticut) yet the diversity here is astounding.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Here is one example of a dish I heard about and read about and had to search high and low all over the markets in Beirut for one of its component: <span>Mung</span> <span>beans</span>! Apparently mung beans are consumed in the North but are very hard to find in the capital. This dish is as rustic as it gets. Mung beans are cooked in water and potatoes are added halfway through. Flavor comes at the end by mixing the two with fried onions and adding salt and black pepper. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Recipe is an adaptation of Chef Ramzi’s <em>Min Turath Lubnan. </em>In the recipe, the potatoes end up mashed and I kept them cubed for vanity’s sake (looks better).</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>3 potatoes, cubed and kept in a bowl of water</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1 cup of mung beans</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1/3 cup of olive oil</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2 large onions</strong></li>\n<li><strong>salt, black pepper, to taste</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> METHOD:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Place the beans in a pot; add three cups of water and bring to a simmer.  Simmer the beans for 20 minutes.

When the potatoes are cooked, add the onions and season to taste.

I think the above photo was taken when there was that cross-country skiing event by the Lebanese Magahaweer. Instead, it looks like our fun-filled, usually carefree ski slopes are as security-hazard-prone as Beirut, which of coure minus the Assir incident recently, is very far from true.</p>\n<p>However, I also appreciate what the photographer is trying to say. Very few nations today, if any, have fully armed soldiers patrolling the streets in this way, or directing traffic, or walking through a nightlife district. I mean, if I was in New York and saw US Marines with their full-gear walking down the 5th Avenue, it’d sorta make me think “the apocalypse is coming” not “oh, just another day in Beirut.” So, this is one of the many things that make Lebanon special. Whether that’s something good or not, I won’t go into that here. But, the fact we need armed <em>soldiers</em> to keep us in line, and Lebanese folks <em>still</em> manage to misbehave, says a lot…</p>\n<p>It’s sparked a comment thread of several hundreds, so you might wanna go through them all and see how everyone’s reacting.</p>\n\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/02/controversial-photo-of-skiing-in-lebanon-by-natgeo-official-instagram-account/screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-45/" title="Screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-45"><img width="84" height="150" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-45.png?w=84&h=150" alt="Screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-45"></a>\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/02/controversial-photo-of-skiing-in-lebanon-by-natgeo-official-instagram-account/screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-51/" title="Screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-51"><img width="84" height="150" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-51.png?w=84&h=150" alt="Screenshot_2013-03-02-11-16-51"></a>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12304/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12304/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12304&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1"></p>\n'),

However, it does raise some great points.</p>\n<p>This video is a live example on how religious books might not have been meant to be taken literally. You are not bound to what your holy book LITERALLY says, unless you want to shut-off your logic portal. You rather interpret the meaning and analyze the metaphors to derive lessons.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s put the concept of blasphemy aside and ask with an open mind</strong>: What is God? Does God need to be seen as a physiologically human-like entity? What if God is an energy? What if God is a fundamental mathematical formula that runs our universe?  What if God is within us and within everything? Is God a mean for us to spiritually connect with everything around us? Would God exist without a purpose?</p>\n<p>I did some research and I saw that, to my surprise, a lot of people have been talking about this and attributing it to many theories worth deliberating. I’m digging into the ‘fundamental mathematical formula’ theories at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s an idea:</strong> If God wanted humanity to have a holy book that would  last for thousands of years (or more), would that book contain literal information? The obvious answer is No. Societies are always changing; what literally applies at one time will not apply in the other. It’s time we take the historical context into consideration and look into the metaphors.</p>\n<p>That’s the way I see it, at least. Any thoughts?</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Q. What is God? Does It have a form or look like paintings of God that we see?</em><br><em>M. Like Michelangelo’s God! No, this is his God, it is Michelangelo’s God. You want to see what God looks like? Who is it who asked this question? Please raise your hand. I will show you immediately. You? Look behind you, your neighbors in front, to your right and left, that is what God looks like. Alright, you are satisfied? God said, “God made man in His own image.” So if you want to find God, look at your neighbors. Each one of us houses God inside. So see through the physical wall and then you will find God in yourself and in each other. So treat each other as God, and then you will see how much different life is day after day’.</em><span> <em>- <a href="http://www.godsdirectcontact.com/teachings/AZGodQA.html">Source</a></em></span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Hmm, I hope Sheikh Assir would give these thoughts some time.</em></p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://mokhlibnene.wordpress.com/category/religion/">Religion</a>  <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mokhlibnene.wordpress.com&blog=32724713&post=1283&subd=mokhlibnene&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

I might be a bit too much of a perfectionist to sew my own clothing!)</p>\n<p>I modified the pattern by adding pockets and cutting the neckline a bit higher because it was a bit too low to be work appropriate.</p>\n<p><a title="Sew U babydoll by Lindsay_NYC, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindslurd/8518625922/"><img alt="Sew U babydoll" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8366/8518625922_1fb5212705_z.jpg" width="640" height="397"></a></p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/category/sewing/">Sewing</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/thepresentperfect.wordpress.com/648/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=thepresentperfect.wordpress.com&blog=12192390&post=648&subd=thepresentperfect&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

Nevertheless, optimism, transparency and perseverance are in my opinion good enough resources to drive any change or reform in Lebanon or in any country, provided that you have a pragmatic approach and a feasible plan.</p>\n<p>Among the many challenges that Lebanon is faced with today, I believe the biggest and most important is the internet as we are missing out on a major digital revolution and have a lot to lose here. Added to that, and as so <a href="http://beirutspring.com/blog/2013/02/18/a-lot-to-lose/">eloquently put by my friend Mustapha</a>, skipping a technology generation might have “potentially disastrous consequences to the competitiveness of our workforce, a problem that not only is not being acknowledged but that we have absolutely no plans to address”.</p>\n<p><strong>My Idea</strong><br>\nHaving said that, what I want to propose is a 3-steps plan that will hopefully bring the internet revolution to the Lebanese community, more specifically to its young and promising generations, and at the same time speed the process of reform and increased transparency in the country. I am personally not a fan of big ideas, and I wouldn’t have proposed this if I didn’t think it was feasible on the short run and more importantly sustainable, knowing how complicated and corrupt things are in Lebanon. Added to that and this is quite sad, a good project initiated by one minister or government in Lebanon may be discontinued by the next one for pure political reasons, which is why I tried to involve the private sector as much as possible into my idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Step1: Come up with New ISP</strong><br>\nLebanon’s population is a young one just like most countries in the Middle East and those who are most affected by this technological gap nowadays are students in schools and universities as they are the ones who will be shaping the future of Lebanon and forming its new workforce. Having said that, the time required to upgrade all of Lebanon’s network and provide unlimited, abundant and cheap internet to all the Lebanese seems a bit far-fetched at the moment. At the same time, coming up with digital districts in Beirut strictly (to be followed by other districts in keys cities) will create a gap between the Lebanese themselves, in addition to the technological gap we are all living, which is unfair and unacceptable. For that purpose, I recommend creating a new ISP by the Telecom Ministry linked to a non-profit organization or entity. This ISP will be solely dedicated to serving educational settings at a first stage which I will discuss in Step2.</p>\n<p><strong>Step2: Turning Universities and Schools into Internet Villages</strong><br>\nSchools and universities are the places where companies go to recruit young and promising talents and this is where we should have ASAP <strong>Innovation centers or internet villages</strong> equipped with the best material and the best internet out there. I am talking fiber optics, 4G connectivity, rooms for e-lectures and the latest laptops/servers/tablets. The role of the ISP created above will be to provide quick and unlimited internet on campuses and have them always up to date and coping with the digital revolution. The infrastructural requirements will be minimal at this point as the ministry will be catering to a relatively small crowd and the hardware and software equipments will be provided and sponsored (up to a certain percentage) by top-notch US companies. I believe we have enough contacts to get large corporations to provide us with their latest products for a competitive price, if not for free. It is very important here to have proper maintenance contracts with these companies in order not to end up with outdated pcs.</p>\n<p>My idea will apply to both public and private establishments. These tech hubs will serve as a space for students to express their creativity, be innovative and follow up on what’s happening in the world. </p>\n<p><strong>Step3: Expand to Towns and Cities</strong><br>\nI remember almost 10 years ago when internet was still very expensive, internet cafes started popping everywhere in Lebanon offering cheap prices. When internet prices were cut down, cafes started disappearing slowly. Similarly, people want high-speed connections these days and after providing them for free in universities and schools, municipalities should initiate such projects and have one tech center or more in their towns. There are tons of partnerships that can be done here to provide the equipment and e-learning courses could be provided as well to those interested.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I am hoping by the time we reach this stage that our infrastructure will be ready to serve all the Lebanese fast, consistent and unlimited internet but if it is not the case, these centers will help speed this process up even further..</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Technology is turbocharging transparency to fight corruption – Bono – </strong><br>\nI posted few days ago about UK Ambassador in Lebanon Tom Fletcher’s views on the many challenges that await Lebanon and I was captivated by one of his quotes that went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>How do you skip a technology generation? Traffic lights, the internet and electricity are great British inventions. Put them in, and the rest will follow – HA Tom Fletcher</p></blockquote>\n<p>The digital era is revolutionizing our societies and the rise of social media and its influence are turning countries upside down. The more internet is easily accessible and widespread in Lebanon, the more influential the online society is becoming and the bigger impact it is having on the decision-makers and people in power. Given that we are a young country and that the aspiring generations are the ones mostly hooked on social media tools and the internet, empowering them the soonest is a must in order to avoid irrevocable consequences and pave the way for ambitious and competitive innovations such as the proposed flying cars or robotized policemen. Trust me I would be the happiest person in the world if I could fly over traffic on my way to work everyday.</p>\n<p>I’d like to hear your feedback on the above idea even if I am submitting this as is. I barely had a day to prepare this in order to meet the deadline, so I am sure there’s some room for improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>PS: This is my entry for the competition run by the Lebanese Telecom Ministry: “<a href="http://www.reinventingtheworld.net/">Lebanese Bloggers Reinvent The World</a>”.</strong></p>\n'),

The damage of course has been repaired, I mean, who on earth wants to wait for the Lebanese government to fix things, right? And here, allow me to thank everyone, individuals and NGOs, who helped these people find shelter and pick up the pieces of their shattered lives when news crews had moved on to the next big story…</p>\n<p>All that happens as thousands of employees and teachers participate in an open strike after years of lies, deceit and raises in our beloved scumbag MPs’ salaries for life, and <a href="http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/12188">even after they die</a>.

Yet, they pay themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars, forever, for not even doing their jobs we pay them for.</p>\n<p>I’m not voting this election. I suggest any candidate dreaming of a vote from me, and maybe many like me, is a pledge from said candidate to stop paying salaries for MPs that are not in elected office anymore, and stop providing them with scores of police officers as personal bodyguards, chauffeurs and valet parking and instead focus on directing traffic, solving kidnapping cases and trying to turn Roumieh from a 5-star accommodation facility for alleged terror suspects into a proper jail, with a proper trail. You know, one with no WiFi and cable TV and mobile phones…</p>\n<p>Of course, they need to pledge loads of other things, but this one thing is inspired from this rude, disgusting misappropriation of funds from people who need it, to billionaire bags of human feces we vote for every 4 years.</p>\n\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/a-wounded-woman-is-carried-at-the-site-of-an-explosion-in-ashrafieh/" title="A wounded woman is carried at the site of an explosion in Ashrafieh"><img width="150" height="105" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wounded-woman-carried-site.jpg?w=150&h=105" alt="A wounded woman is carried at the site of an explosion in Ashrafieh"></a>\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/lebanon-unrest-explosion-2/" title="LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION"><img width="150" height="112" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lebanese-workers-firefighters-site.jpg?w=150&h=112" alt="LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION"></a>\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/a-woman-is-helped-by-a-lebanese-soldier-after-an-explosion-in-ashafriyeh-district/" title="A woman is helped by a Lebanese soldier after an explosion in Ashafriyeh district"><img width="150" height="103" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/woman-helped-lebanese-explosion.jpg?w=150&h=103" alt="A woman is helped by a Lebanese soldier after an explosion in Ashafriyeh district"></a>\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/lebanon-unrest/" title="LEBANON-UNREST"><img width="150" height="112" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/security-forces-workers-gather.jpg?w=150&h=112" alt="LEBANON-UNREST"></a>\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/01/everything-you-own-got-destroyed-by-a-car-bomb-here-have-5-million-liras/lebanon-unrest-explosion/" title="LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION"><img width="150" height="108" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lebanese-forensic-security-forces.jpg?w=150&h=108" alt="LEBANON-UNREST-EXPLOSION"></a>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12295/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12295/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12295&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1"></p>\n'),

And like anyone living in this country the thought of  someone with her judgement in parliament terrifies me. And no I’m not gonna jump on the let’s hate on Myriam Klink bandwagon, I’m guessing she has enough of those.</p>\n<p>To me the idea of giving power to a woman with such heinous fashion taste,  bad PR and disastrous image management decisions to make vital decisions on a national level makes me slightly uneasy. I’m sure you can relate.</p>\n<p>I watched her on AlJadeed’s new show <strong>Al Za3eem “الزعيم”</strong> which seems like an Arab Idol for aspiring politicians who present themselves in front of a panel of judges and get eliminated accordingly. (a very badly produced concept and show might I add.)</p>\n<p>Contestants were tested on their speech skills. Some yelled, others threatened, a few seemed to think they were auditioning for a cheesy Lebanese play only to get royally butchered by the panel of judges who showed no mercy.</p>\n<p>And then there was Klink. She stood there, fully clothed, looking mighty professional and gave a very well-rehearsed speech ( you’ll be surprised how good she was compared to the rest) with dramatic and funny hand gestures on two issues she plans to run on. Her first choice impressed me. The environment. She seemed to have a special relationship with nature as her <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MyriamKlinkPage">Facebook bio</a> puts it so eloquently</p>\n<p><i>“Myriam Klink is a Lebanese girl from the mountains raised between animals and natures by a loving dad and grand pa who teach her the meaning of respecting life in all its ways….”</i></p>\n<p>But then she said the words I dreaded. Something about women, their rights and well she summed it up with something along the lines of <em>“men have to not forget that they all came from women!”</em>  You know, just in case some men were doubting the birds and bees theory.</p>\n<p>But I’m approaching this with an open mind. Of course I’ve made prejudgments based on everything I see about Klink online; the distasteful photos, her obnoxious behavior and the baffling video clips. Does she stand a real chance of winning? Probably not. But could this be her moment to give us something more than Made In Lebanon Paris Hilton, and perhaps even use her star power to bring attention to issues that should really be high on this country’s priority list such as our depleting environment and animal rights? Perhaps. As long as she steers clear from women’s rights.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-2.jpg"><img alt="Myriam Klink AlJadeed New TV 2" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-2.jpg?w=500&h=426" width="500" height="426"></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv.jpg"><img alt="Myriam Klink AlJadeed New TV" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv.jpg?w=500&h=341" width="500" height="341"></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-3.jpg"><img alt="Myriam Klink AlJadeed New TV 3" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/myriam-klink-aljadeed-new-tv-3.jpg?w=500&h=345" width="500" height="345"></a></p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ivysays.wordpress.com/5177/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ivysays.wordpress.com/5177/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ivysays.com&blog=11241585&post=5177&subd=ivysays&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

Have you?” I replied.<br>\n“Not yet. But man, I can’t believe how anyone would fathom being with Hariri after it!”<br>\n“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll read it when part 2 is released.”</p>\n<p>Part 2 is currently in the works as a reply to part 1.</p>\n<p>FPMers are having a field day with a recently released book from their MPs, mainly Ibrahim Kenaan which revealed “for the first time ever” some secrets about the Hariri era in Lebanese politics. You can buy the book for $8 at any bookstore. It has more tables in it than a Certified Public Accountant would like to handle and its purpose is more than clear: serve as pre-electoral political propaganda, as is their right. </p>\n<p>They have begun to use the term “<em>ebra2ihom al mousta7il</em>” to categorize the Future Movement on their Facebook pages and political websites.</p>\n<p>My premise isn’t about the book’s content. It’s about the point behind the book. Who among us does not know that the Hariri era of politics was riddled with corruption? Well, if you don’t now you do. And if you don’t think it did, then your conviction borders on the delusional.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend for a moment that Hariri was the only person running the show from the 1990 to 2005, his government not having any other participant, and ask the following: don’t FPM ministers have their own “ebra2 l mousta7il” from 2005 onwards?</p>\n<p>A Western company is suing Gebran Bassil for the way he handled one of the many bids that pass under his ministry. Isn’t that corruption?<br>\nThe following <a href="http://www.14march.org/news-details.php?nid=NDI1Nzg0">link</a> portrays severe transgressions of Minister Bassil and Layoun (minister of culture) in Batroun, which MTV is currently investigating, whereby the ministry of culture takes over old Lebanese houses for a very cheap amount of money, gets Gebran to renovate them and sell them for massive amounts. Or how about the diesel scandal that took place last year?</p>\n<p>We can also talk about minister Layoun’s disgusting practices in the minister of culture, from allowing the demolishing of the Roman hippodrome to the Phoenician port to many of Beirut’s old houses, including Amin Maalouf’s. How about we look at Layoun’s wealth before and after him taking on the mantle of the ministry?</p>\n<p>The aforementioned transgressions are based on a few minutes of research here and there that I, a blogger who doesn’t register on our politicians’ radar, was able to pull off.</p>\n<p>FPMers will dismiss this previous <a href="http://www.14march.org/news-details.php?nid=NDI1Nzg0">link</a> immediately based on its source, as will those who are against the FPM will dismiss their book because their source is very political. </p>\n<p><em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> is not a book for the Lebanese masses because you can’t offer one side of the corruption story in Lebanese politics and expect people who differ from you politically to take you seriously. I will not read <em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> because, despite keeping an open mind (most of the time) to different scenarios in the country, I know for a fact that the other side which the book doesn’t portray, obviously, committed transgressions that may or may not be as severe as the side the book does, in fact, portray. But that’s not the point.</p>\n<p>The point is that every single political party in this country has, upon reaching power committed corrupt acts. The point is that blaming the entire country’s financial and economic problems, through a book such as <em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> on one single politician and his party, however corrupt that politician was, is illogical and non-sensical.</p>\n<p><em>Al Ebra2 Al Mousta7il</em> is a book that will get those who support the FPM to support the party even further without even reading the book. Let’s be honest, most FPMers won’t read it and will count on their politicians telling them what the book contains. Those who are against the FPM will dismiss it as nonsense. And come election time, no one will really remember it.</p>\n<p>And the merry goes round. </p>\n<p>Hariri was corrupt, sure. But Hariri was not the only one who’s corrupt. People with glass houses should not throw stones. Everyone has their own <em>ebra2 al mousta7il</em>.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/elections-2013/">Elections 2013</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/lebanon/">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/politics-2/">Politics</a> Tagged: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/al-ebra2-el-mousta7il/">Al Ebra2 El Mousta7il</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/aoun/">Aoun</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/corruption/">corruption</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/fpm/">FPM</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/gaby-layoun/">Gaby Layoun</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/gebran-bassil/">Gebran Bassil</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/hariri/">Hariri</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%84/">الإبراء المستحيل</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6882/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=6882&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

السفير دانيال بنجامين في خضم لقائه مع نظرائه السوريين في دمشق في فبراير 2010، كجزء من «سياسة الانخراط» مع نظام بشار الاسد، عند دخول ضابط رفيع المستوى وقف له الحاضرون. «علي مملوك»، قدم احد المشاركين الضابط المذكور. </div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nتفاصيل اللقاء، الذي شهد مشاركة غير متوقعة من «مدير امن الدولة» السوري في حينه، ظهرت الى العلن في برقية ديبلوماسية سرية الى واشنطن، كشف عنها موقع «ويكيليكس» في ما بعد، وورد فيها ان مملوك قال للزائر الاميركي ان بلاده لطالما كانت «اكثر نجاحا من الولايات المتحدة والدول الاخرى في المنطقة في مكافحة الارهاب لاننا لا نهاجمهم ونقتلهم فورا، بل نخترقهم، ولا نتحرك الا في اللحظة المناسبة».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nطبعا لم يكن بنجامين يتصور ان نجاح مملوك الباهر يعني ان نظام الاسد سيستخدم مقاتلات «ميغ» وصواريخ «سكود» لقتل اكبر عدد ممكن من معارضي استمرار حكم الاسد. ولم يكن بنجامين يتصور كذلك ان الرجل نفسه الذي كانت واشنطن تسعى الى التعامل معه من اجل «مكافحة الارهاب» سينتهي به المطاف على لائحة «الارهابيين» المطلوبين في الولايات المتحدة والاتحاد الاوروبي.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nحتى في لبنان، اصدر القضاء مذكرة توقيف بحق مملوك بتهمة تزويده الوزير اللبناني السابق ميشال سماحة بعبوات لاستهداف شخصيات سنية في شمال لبنان بهدف اثارة النعرات وإشعال الاقتتال الطائفي. </div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nمنذ اندلاع الثورة السورية في مارس 2011، انقلبت الصورة. سماحة اصبح في السجن، ومملوك نال ترقية ليخلف هشام بختيار، الذي قضى في تفجير قام به الثوار، «رئيسا لمكتب الامن القومي» لنظام الاسد. اما بنجامين، فخرج من الوزارة مع خروج الوزيرة هيلاري كلينتون.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nفي السنوات الثلاث الماضية، الصورة انقلبت في واشنطن كذلك. </div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nعندما التقى بنجامين مملوك، لم يتطرق المسؤول الاميركي، خريج جامعة هارفرد المرموقة والمتخصص في شؤون التطرف الاسلامي وخصوصا في باكستان وافغانستان، الى مجموعات تعتبرها واشنطن ارهابية، مثل «حزب الله» اللبناني. سلم بنجامين مملوك لائحة من الاسماء لـ «ارهابيين» مطلوبين للولايات المتحدة ينتمون الى «تنظيم القاعدة» او التنظيمات التابعة له.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nقبل العام 2011، كان للارهاب في واشنطن مذهب واحد، وكان امثال سماحة يقودون حملة اعلامية لاقناع اميركا والغرب ان كل اتباع هذا المذهب، أكانوا متطرفين او معتدلين، هم ارهابيون، وان مصلحة الغرب هي في التعاون مع الاسد، وربما ايران و«حزب الله»، للقضاء عليهم.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nفي العام 2007، في خضم المواجهة بين الجيش اللبناني و«تنظيم فتح الاسلام» في مخيم اللاجئين الفلسطينيين «نهر البارد» في شمال لبنان، نشرت مجلة «نيويوركر» الرصينة مقالا للكاتب سيمور هيرش نقل فيه عن العميل السابق في الاستخبارات البريطانية اليستر كروك قوله التالي: «قيل لي انه في غضون 24 ساعة (علي قيام تنظيم فتح الاسلام)، توالت عليهم عروض المال والتسليح من اشخاص قدموا انفسهم كممثلين لمصالح الحكومة اللبنانية، افتراضا حتى يشنوا حربا ضد حزب الله».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nهذا التصريح تلقفه مسؤولو «حزب الله» وحلفاؤهم اللبنانيون لاتهام رئيس حكومة لبنان في حينه فؤاد السنيورة، ورئيس كتلة «المستقبل» النيابية في ذلك الحين سعد الحريري، بدعم «التطرف الاسلامي في لبنان»، وتم تداول مقالة هيرش على نطاق واسع في لبنان والعواصم الغربية.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nوفي وقت لاحق، تبين ان هيرش كان من اصدقاء سماحة، الذي قدمه الى كروك الذي يدير مركزا للابحاث في بيروت مقربا من «حزب الله»، وان التقرير كان جزءا من عملية اعلامية محكمة يقودها سماحة، العامل بامرة مملوك، وحليف «حزب الله».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nلكن الثورة السورية قلبت الصورة في سورية ولبنان، كما في واشنطن.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nاول من امس، تصدرت الصفحة الاولى لصحيفة «واشنطن بوست» مقالة اعتبرت ان «حزب الله» يعمل على توسيع نشاطاته للقيام بهجمات في عواصم غربية، ووردت فيها تفاصيل التحقيقات القبرصية مع عضو الحزب الموقوف حسام يعقوب. كما تطرقت المقالة الى امكانية مشاركة الحزب بتفجير بلغاريا، وموضوع موافقة الاتحاد الاوروبي على وضع الحزب على لائحة التنظيمات الارهابية بعد سنوات طويلة من مقاومة الضغط الاميركي في هذا الشأن.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nوقبل اسبوع، نشرت مجلة «نيويوركر» نفسها مقالة حملت عنوان «ان سقط نظام الاسد، هل يمكن لحزب الله الاستمرار؟».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nهذه المرة لم يتمكن سماحة المسجون من التأثير في ما تنشره المجلة الاميركية، او مقالها الذي كتبه ديكستر فيلكنز، الذي اجرى مقابلة مع مسؤول عسكري في «حزب الله»، واطلق عليه اسما مستعارا هو داني. </div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nيقول فيلكنز ان «امكانية غالبية سنية او حتى نظام اصولي، يأتي الى الحكم في سورية بدت مرعبة الى درجة ان داني بدا وكأنه صار يؤيد اسرائيل». يقول داني، حسب فيلكنز، «اذا ما استولى السنة على سورية، فسوف نقاتلهم في بيروت».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nوينقل فيلكنز عن امل سعد غريب، التي كانت تقدم نفسها في الماضي القريب على انها باحثة محايدة وتعمل مع «مركز ابحاث كارنيغي» الاميركي في بيروت، قولها: «اذا ما فازوا ورحلت حكومة الاسد، فاتصور انهم سيحاولون نزع سلاح حزب الله». وتضيف سعد غريب، التي يصفها فيلكنز بالكاتبة المقربة من قادة «حزب الله»، ان الحزب «سوف يضطر الى الدفاع عن نفسه».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nفي هذه الاثناء، شارك السفير بنجامين في لقاء حواري في «معهد واشنطن لدراسات الشرق الادنى» اعتبر خلاله ان نشاط «حزب الله» خارج الشرق الاوسط وصل الى مراحل غير مسبوقة منذ التسعينات. وقال بنجامين ان هذا الحزب «لا يقوم بهجمات متفرقة، بل متورط حاليا في حملة ارهابية» من اجل «تحذير الغرب ضد قيامه بأي تدخل عسكري في ايران».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nواوضح بنجامين: «حزب الله يعتقد اننا اصلا في صراع، ولكنهم يريدون ان يوصلوا الينا رسالة عما يمكنهم القيام به في حال تطور الصراع».</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nاذا الصورة في واشنطن تغيرت جذريا في السنوات القليلة الاخيرة. اللوبي الذي كان يقوده سماحة داخل العاصمة الاميركية تضعضع. كروك، الذي زار اميركا مرارا لتسويق كتابه ونظريته القائلة بضرورة تحالف اميركا مع «محور الشمال» المؤلف من ايران والعراق وتركيا وسورية ولبنان، لم يعد مرحبا به. هيرش منشغل عن الشرق الاوسط بنقاشات مع اميركيين حول شؤون داخلية يعقدها بشكل شبه يومي في فندق «تابارد ان» حيث يتناول فطوره، في وقت انتقل صديقه الآخر، سفير الاسد السابق في اميركا عماد مصطفى، الى الصين.</div>\n<div dir="rtl">\nاشياء كثيرة تغيرت في سنوات قليلة، وتقدم «حزب الله» من الصفوف الخلفية للتنظيمات الارهابية الى الصدارة. ترى لو قيض لبنجامين لقاء مملوك مرة اخرى، فهل كان سيطالبه بالتعاون لمواجهة الحزب اللبناني هذه المرة؟</div>\n</div></div>'),

Across multiple disciplines, from history to literature, religious studies to philosophy, archaeology to music, scholars are tapping the extraordinary power of digital technologies to preserve, curate, analyze, visualize, and reconstruct their research objects.</p>\n<p>The humanistic study of the Middle East and the broader Islamic world has been no less impacted by this new paradigm. Scholars are making daily use of digital tools and repositories including private and state-sponsored archives of textual sources, digitized manuscript collections, densitometrical imaging, visualization and modeling software, and various forms of data mining and analysis. However, there have been few calls to bring researchers together to showcase their experiments in digital humanistic scholarship within their respective fields, or to discuss the opportunities and challenges engendered by this changing scholarly ecosystem.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, <a href="http://www.middleeastbrown.org/"><strong>Middle East Studies at Brown University</strong></a> – with the support of the Brown Humanities Initiative – is pleased to announce a pioneering conference on October 24-25 2013 that will explore the state of the art in digital scholarship pertaining to Islamic & Middle East Studies. Some of the guiding questions we are interested in include:</p>\n<p>(1) Where are the most important digitization projects of historical sources in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and other languages taking place around the world?</p>\n<p>(2) What kinds of digital technologies and methodologies have proven most fruitful for scholars in different disciplines (e.g. data mining, pattern recognition, social network analysis, etc.)?</p>\n<p>(3) How are existing technologies challenged by the manipulation of data in non-Western languages, and what are the most significant technological desiderata for researchers?</p>\n<p>(4) As digital tools and media become more widespread, what ethical issues relating to privacy and human consent must be carefully considered, particularly in projects involving contemporary political and social issues?</p>\n<p>We are happy to welcome as our keynote speaker <strong>Dr. Dwight Reynolds</strong> (Professor of Religious Studies, UCSB), who is among many other things the architect of the Sirat Bani Hilal Digital Archive, “an open access resource for the preservation and dissemination of audio recordings, written texts, photographic images and other materials related to the Epic of the Bani Hilal Tribe,” a thousand-year-old epic poem. The conference will be webcast and several papers may be selected for publication in an edited volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Submissions:</strong> We welcome submissions from scholars and graduate students in diverse disciplines. Interested candidates are kindly requested to submit a title and abstract of 300 words to the conference organizers at digitalhumanitiesconference {at} gmail {dot} com. The deadline for submissions is <strong>April 1st, 2013</strong>, and successful applicants will be notified by mid-April. Papers should be no longer than 20 minutes and should be read in English.</p>\n<p>Depending on the number of participants, <em><strong>there will be limited funds available for travel and accommodation</strong></em>. Brown University is located in Providence, Rhode Island, about one hour south of Boston. For any questions, please contact Dr. Elias Muhanna at the email address above. Additional information will soon be available on the conference website.</p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5325/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/qifanabki.wordpress.com/5325/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=qifanabki.com&blog=4404162&post=5325&subd=qifanabki&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

Various individuals and groups effectively claim existence, label their territories, as well as write and re-write their histories — Lebanon has no one history. I refer to this as a “debate” because of this back and forth, of placement and replacement, which lies in stark contrast to the monologue that rises above buildings and highways, the one-way beaming of high-priced messages as represented by billboards and advertising space.</p>\n<p>Recently, these two “conversational” spaces have mixed, if not melded — with corporate messengers vying for equal footing with straightforward political, theological and economic discourses. On closer inspection, however, they are unequal: messages moving from the street upwards have a rebellious aim; those moving from the ad space down have a much more sinister source.</p>\n<p><b>Independence ‘05</b></p>\n<p>On March 14, 2005, a large percentage of the Lebanese population hit the streets of Beirut, protesting Syrian domination of its political and economic infrastructures. The demonstrations, which arose after the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, coincided with the almost immediate emergence of “Independence ‘05” banners, stickers and other merchandise like flags and hats. Designed collectively by some of Beirut’s top ad agency talents, the red, white and green logo soon appeared everywhere [see Fig. 1]. Not missing a beat, the U.S. State Department renamed the locally known Intifada of Independence as the Cedar Revolution, and for a brief time, to the outside world at least, it seemed that Lebanon was going down the road paved by other “branded” revolutions, such as those in Georgia and Ukraine also underwritten by American NGOs.</p>\n<p>The manufactured logo’s invasion was striking during those first weeks of co-opted activism, its pre-packaged message disseminating rapidly through the streets. Eventually, Syria withdrew its troops, and by the time Christmas arrived, Dar an-Nahar (the publishing arm of <i>an-Nahar</i> newspaper) came out with a glossy coffee-table book documenting The Beirut Spring — complete with a kit of patriotic artifacts — almost as if to say, yet again: “Mission Accomplished!”</p>\n<p>For the past two years, however, a series of bombings, assassinations and all-out warfare has redefined those original ideas of “Independence” and has led to the surreal situation where the absence of dialogue on the governmental level is contrasted by an endless stream of mediated messages.</p>\n<p>Since Israel’s war against Lebanon last summer, these different levels of discourse — street and ad, local and global — have scrambled for prominence. Advertisers, mostly banks, plastered the country with ads touting their role in rebuilding; Johnnie Walker, among many others, made reference to the destruction of the country’s infrastructure in both its imagery and ad copy [see Fig. 2]. The line between advertising and public expression often blurred: billboards for General Michel Aoun’s Free Patriotic Movement featured “hand-drawn” orange checkmarks, only to be rivaled by huge “homemade” banners — mostly featuring Condoleezza Rice as purveyor of bombs for Lebanese children or as schoolmarm to Prime Minister Fouad Siniora — draped across buildings downtown.</p>\n<p>Likewise, in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs, another advertising campaign had taken shape, startling in its assimilation of these “designed messages” and distance from the insular iconography and Arabic-only statements formerly seen on the ground. Aimed at international journalists, it documented the wholesale destruction of entire neighborhoods with a retort of victory — Nasr min Allah or “Divine Victory” — playing on the name of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. These banners, in French, English and Arabic, and featuring other messages such as “The New Middle (B)east,” were hung from every building even remotely left standing [see Fig. 3].</p>\n<p>The political dialogue that should have been taking place on a national and international level has been reduced to empty sound bites by agencies such as Saatchi & Saatchi and H&C Leo Burnett, which made sectarianism its target in a new campaign for <i>al-Mujtamah al-Madani</i> (Civil Society). The first run of print ads featured personalized objects like mailboxes, doctors’ office signs and license plates, identifying not only names and numbers but also sect affiliation, a commentary on the factional system that governs all aspects of Lebanese life [see Figs. 4-5].</p>\n<p>In corresponding television spots, actors representing other countries proudly declare, in their respective languages: <i>Je suis francais</i>, and “I am an American” [see Fig. 6]. Yet the Lebanese claim: <i>Ana Sunni</i>, <i>Ana Shi’i</i>, <i>Ana Dirzi</i>, and <i>Ana Marounieh</i>, not <i>Ana Lubnani</i> (“I am Lebanese”). Shots ring out, and our Lebanese protagonists are left with their heads hanging in shame [see Fig. 7]. The ads seem to blame the Lebanese population itself for its “backwards” nature instead of blaming the outside political and economic forces that have long imposed those divisions, and offer an ignominious, orientalist cliche that is absurd in its reduction and shamefully outdated in its casting of a blond-haired, blue-eyed man as the American. Are Americans not multicultural? Do they not take pride in their own hyphenated identities?</p>\n<p>Another advertising project reminiscent of the “Independence ‘05” campaign appeared as well, featuring “martyr” Christmas trees, trilingual billboards and mobile ad trucks animated by live actors, broadcasting the message: “I love life” [see Fig. 8]. The slogan is offensive in its equation of the Shi’a of Lebanon as, culturally speaking, “lovers of death.” <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article6364.shtml">Further research revealed it to be a campaign sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)</a> and reflective of other U.S.-sponsored initiatives in Ukraine and Africa.</p>\n<p>In this world of meta-communication, the reality of the situation becomes increasingly obfuscated. What the West interprets as a clash of civilizations is really about class differences — the haves and the have-nots, capital and labor, the first world and the other four-fifths of the planet. Seen through these advertising campaigns, “America” and “Democracy” — and by extension, free-market capitalism — become simply a product to sell, a brand to push, and logically (and cynically), advertisers have been hired to do the job. The greater problem for the pushers of the product is that the peoples of the world have grown wise to the pitch — especially when those pushing this local variant of the global “brand,” Saatchi & Saatchi, are simultaneously working on the rebranding of Israel, to create a “narrative of normalcy” after the war this past summer.</p>\n<p><b>“You say you want a revolution…”</b></p>\n<p>In the past, brand identity was based intrinsically on the notion of an untarnished image. Trying to sell something that was below par was once considered hucksterism; salesmen thereof were seen as peddling snake oil. So ingrained is this accepted notion of pushing a lie that it is part of American folklore and imbedded in its culture, seen in everything from tall tales and <i>The Music Man</i> to the infomercials of Ron Popeil.</p>\n<p>As free-market capitalism progressed, this marketing evolved, and at a certain point (as <i>No Logo</i> by Naomi Klein points out) the product ceased to matter. A brand name represented not so much the product itself — sneakers, clothing, perfume, and now, democratic society — but the lifestyle pushed by the company whose logo decorated the product’s exterior. Nike, Gap, Calvin Klein, and now, America — a brand ready for export.</p>\n<p>Today no one is sufficiently outraged when images of radical icons are licensed to pimp products (postmortem): think Dr. Martin Luther King for Alcatel and Cingular; William S. Burroughs for Nike. No one gets upset when the environmental movement is effectively stifled by the co-opting of environmentalism as a marketing sales point; when former outlets for the expression of anger by marginalized groups are turned into revenue streams; when “Revolution” by the Beatles is heard in a Nike ad; when AIDSand breast cancer are used as marketing ploys.</p>\n<p>And so it follows that no one in the West is fazed by the simplistic notion that a country as incredibly complex as Lebanon, with its millennia of history, should be reduced to its people’s religious differences. Present-day America lives vicariously through the democratic movements of other countries and a projected sense of universal wellbeing that is ever harder to find at home. For just one example, the falling Berlin Wall became the backdrop for the false concept that all ideals of democracy emanate from the U.S., and, furthermore, that advertising is a proper venue for the dissemination of this ideal.</p>\n<p>Now, the concept of a “revolution” beneficial to Lebanon is ignored unless it can be used as a feel-good device for Western democracies to perceive themselves as having played a part in the country’s “independence” which, in fact, goes back half a century; the inaction of these countries this past summer paints a completely different picture in terms of their intentions. Whereas here in Lebanon the battle is still being played out (literally and figuratively), the bigger picture is much more serious — and horrifyingly more disastrous — for those of us living on the periphery of global capital’s various expansionist projects.</p>\n<p><b>Countering the Lie</b></p>\n<p>This empty brand identity, the Lie, is betrayed when a demonstration (seen as pro-U.S.) is painted as a “Cedar Revolution,” while the more recent, broader-reaching demonstrations are called “a pro-Syrian/Iranian threat” and an attempted “coup d’etat.” As stated by economist Samir Amin in the book <i>Obsolescent Capitalism</i>, the only political Islamic groups in this region targeted by American opprobrium — Hezbollah and Hamas — just happen to be those that are anti-imperialist in nature; they also happen to be democratically elected. In his article “Mid-point in the Middle East?” Tariq Ali concurs: “Western enthusiasm for rainbow revolutions stops, as is to be expected, when the color is green.” Similarly, South American countries, overturning the pro-imperialist governments that replaced their former democracies, are perceived as “threats” to this new world order, when in fact they only threaten the given economic status quo. Why aren’t their “democratic revolutions” celebrated and advertised?</p>\n<p>The Lie, as marketed by Leo Burnett (et. al.), goes back to Woodrow Wilson, who, when the Ottoman Empire was carved up among the post-War imperial powers, stated in his Twelfth Point: “… the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development.” Security of life — sounds catchy. But we didn’t get it then, and despite the current ad-based efforts to convince us of the contrary, we don’t see it on our horizon now. Furthermore, when foreign policy goals of globalizing entities in the region explicitly state their desire to continue to “carve up” Arab countries into more manageable ethnic or religious cantons, these calls to difference hidden behind anti-sectarian messages can be seen to be even more loaded, as well as more lethal.</p>\n<p>In response to the advertisers, designers and cultural sign-makers selling “Democracy,” opponents have spoken back by sending up the original ads themselves, thus forcing an uninvited dialogue. In Dahiyeh, those Arabic posters stating “We want to live” now include (in simulated spraypaint) “… in tents” (referring to the ongoing protest downtown); and “I love life” is now followed by “in colors” (referring to the multi-colored representative rainbow of all of Lebanon’s political parties).</p>\n<p>Some intrepid activists have added their own messages to the mix, such as “I [heart]<i>Aishti</i>” (both a reference to the local chain fashion outlet and <i>aish</i>, the Arabic root for “to live”) and “I [heart] Capitalism” [see Figs. 10, 11]. When those who craft the ad campaigns circulate jpegs of the opposition posters [see Fig. 9] with copy that reads “We want to live … in tents” and labeled “They hate life,” we begin to see the vested and invested interest(s) in these message battles. Quoting Samir Amin once again:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ideological discourse designed to rally public opinion in the central Triad [the United States, Japan and Europe] has been revamped to focus on a ‘duty to intervene’ in the name of ‘democracy,’ ‘national rights’ or ‘humanitarian considerations.’ But whereas the cynical instrumentalization and double standards involved in this discourse seem evident to people in Asia or Africa, Western public opinion has fallen in with it as enthusiastically as it did with the discourses of earlier phases of imperialism.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The visual creators and designers of this “ideological discourse” of ad campaigns currently running in Lebanon today should consider the ethical ramifications of their efforts, which focus on the purely reductive surface level and are representative of an unproven, and therefore unknowable, base ideology (although we can theorize about what is driving it); compared to, say, a political group with a stated political agenda. The fabricators of the larger discourse behind the ads should know that their message, and their media, are seen for what they are: shills for snake oil.</p>\n<p>The bleak cynicism of message makers and the powers they serve — simultaneously blaming the Lebanese for sectarianism while playing to the segregationist, if not “anti-other,” sentiments of a subsection of the Lebanese population; claiming one revolution while condemning any other; placing economic blame on the current opposition movement while fronting an economic reality that will plunder the country; harping on the concept of Lebanon as a unified nation while fomenting discord that would render the nation asunder; working for the destroyers of Lebanon as well as “for” the destroyed — approaches something deeply and darkly Orwellian, especially when using words such as “love” and “life.” There is a huge difference between wanting to live at the expense of others and wanting to live a dignified existence. In light of events this past summer, it can be stated that the current influx of cash to pro-American NGOs, state militias and advertising campaigns is just a continuation of the aggression recently suffered by Lebanon.</p>\n<p>Paul Rand stated: “Design … is also an instrument of disorder and confusion. Design for deception is often more persuasive than design for good; seduction is one of its many masks.” Those pushing the current discourse in Lebanon should not be surprised that it should thus be unmasked; that much of the world outside of their frame of reference is no longer buying their line, their lie, or their lifestyle; and that the Revolution, when it comes, will not be to their liking.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Drennan, originally from Beirut, returned to Lebanon eight years ago, worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Architecture and Design at the American University of Beirut, and is currently the Graphic Design Department coordinator at the American University of Science and Technology.

Second, they can easily be identified since they all have an SSID (network name) following this pattern “BlinkXXXXXX” where XXXXXX is a 6 character code, and this isn’t just any random code as it is derived from the router’s serial number. Unfortunately, the same applies to the WiFi password, it isn’t generated randomly but rather derived from the router’s serial number as well.</p>\n<p>Logically speaking, if you encounter a Blink network and were able to reverse the operation in a way that lets you guess the router’s serial number from the 6 character code in the SSID, retrieving the password would then be a piece of cake since it can be derived from this serial. That’s basically what some people have been doing for a while now since several tools are already available online allowing you enter the 6 character code once you stumble across a Blink network, and gives you the password in a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Up until lately, I was thinking the usage of these tools was somehow minimal and limited to techies since you will rarely find them on Lebanese website, until I lately came across this new Android application called “<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hack.blink">Hack Blink</a>” with a download count of over 10,000 and rapidly increasing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.plus961.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hack-blink.jpg" rel="lightbox[6438]"><img alt="hack blink" src="http://www.plus961.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hack-blink-179x300.jpg" width="179" height="300"></a></p>\n<p>Using the application is very straight forward, you enter the code and wait for the password, I tried it and it does work. So if you have a blink subscription, be sure someone around you will soon or later have this application and eventually start consuming your bandwidth.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there is a way to stop people from doing that by reconfiguring your router using <a href="http://www.ogero.gov.lb/admin/BillDetails/DSL/ThomsonModemSecurityGuide.pdf">this manual</a> I found on Ogero’s website (which applies to Thomson routers). I strongly recommend you use that manual to change your SSID and setting the encryption algorithm to WPA2, in addition to of course changing the default wireless password. If you encounter any difficulty, make sure to either contact their customer support or just head to the nearest Ogero office in order for some support person to help you do it.</p>\n<p>Best solution is definitely for Ogero to stop ordering their routers to be configured this way!</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/zuz">@ZuZ</a> for the information he previously provided in <a href="http://lebgeeks.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=8524">this post</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://twitter.com/AbirGhattas">@AbirGhattas</a> just informed me “Hack Blink” was removed from the Play Store. I still recommend you change your router’s default settings.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Plus961/~4/jUFIkUUZPUE" height="1" width="1">\n'),

You first see your mother through your eyes. You first hear her voice through your ears. You first feel her touch through your skin, smell her hair through you nose and taste the food you are given through your taste buds.</p>\n<p>These sensory experiences help shape your brain dramatically – they alter your cognition and your interaction with the world around you in ways that you can’t even quantify.</p>\n<p>Now imagine you lost one of the organs responsible for your senses. Imagine you lost one of your eyes due to some freak accident. Imagine you were born with a genetic condition of deficient bone conduction in your ear or very few sensory cells in your nose to smell. Imagine for a second that your interaction with the world today is lacking one major aspect and you’ll see how hard it is. You only need to close one eye while walking with a few friends in order to see how your visual field is reduced.</p>\n<p>I have had one uncle who lost his eye as a child to a heater-related accident. My uncle has passed away now, may he rest in peace, but the loss of his eye was a life changing experience that, regardless of the psychological aspect of the matter, affected his life negatively. My best friend suffers from the same thing: he lost his eye because he was a playful little boy with a heightened sense of curiosity. My cousin has deficiency in his hearing and is helped with hearing aids that don’t give him the proper sense of hearing that you and I have but a sense that allows him to make do and lead a normal life – or as normal a life as you could lead.</p>\n<p>Lebanon is a country of war. We have all gone through very horrible life circumstances that have left many in Lebanon impaired. Some have had lasting damage to their spinal cord, leaving them crippled. Others have had their limbs completely amputated. The image is one that’s very hard to imagine.</p>\n<p>The above premise leads me to the following:</p>\n<p><strong>My idea:</strong></p>\n<p>What if I could give my best friend an eye that allows him to see the world the way I see it, that allows him to see people who walk on the side of his non-functional eye? What if I could give my cousin a cochlea that not only gets him to hear but gives him a perfect sense of hearing? What if we can give all the war injured people prosthetic limbs that do not only serve minimal function but can emulate the function of the limb they lost?</p>\n<p>Let’s take it a step further: what if we can extend the average life span, better life circumstances and improve the human condition?</p>\n<p>As a medical student, I am faced daily with countless diseases, even those with a genetic basis, whose only “purpose” is to lead to this organ failing or that. My job is to cut this path of destruction at a point which leaves the organ in question salvageable enough for me to give the patient a better quality of life. But what if I’m too late? And what if I can’t find a transplant organ in time?</p>\n<p>As things stand today, the only hope for my figurative patient is to die.</p>\n<p>All of these terminally-ill patients, impaired, blind & amputated people may have hope if we broaden our approach to our own body by employing the technological advances we have reached these days and create organs that combine this nano-technology that’s being pioneered around the world with the medical expertise that is available plenty.</p>\n<p>By creating a bionic eye, which combines medicine and technology which is helping shape medicine daily, someone who is blind might regain his sight. By integrating some minimal AI function on a prosthetic limb, an amputee might regain normal function in that limb.  By manufacturing a heart, the countless people around the Earth who suffer from cardiac conditions could find a way to become better.</p>\n<p>The list goes on. Imagine the possibilities if whichever organ comes to your mind is no longer a piece of fiction but a certainty that requires tinkering an approach and incorporating different disciplines together. The paths of the sciences are not as divided as people make them out to be. They are intertwined in more ways than they differ.</p>\n<p>The lifespan of these bionic organs would also be superior to the span of normal organs. Their availability means that any case of dysfunction can be fixed by pinpointing the circuit that’s leading to the shortage.</p>\n<p>What could we as Lebanese do? We have the minds and the medical expertise that could help shape this. And we have a lot of Lebanese youth whose pride and joy is technology – not just those who admire their smartphones but those who can actually build a smartphone or repair one in a matter of minutes. What those people need and currently lack is resources.</p>\n<p>You might say that such a plan is perhaps too far-fetched or too ambitious given where we are today. And perhaps it is. But going beyond the limitation of this body that we have might prove to be a key-point in bettering our life in so many other ways. These bionic organs can help us understand what we don’t currently understand about current bodily functions, notably neural, which we are currently ignorant about. The purpose of these organs might even surpass their imminent use and lead to a different approach to life in which people begin to tackle the problems that everyone faces in a more meaningful way, be it from pollution, to energy.</p>\n<p>My opinion is that this is the next frontier that medicine will be embarking on. If we, as Lebanese of the newer generation, embark on it, we might be able to catch up to the entire world in so many ways. Perhaps it’s worth a shot.</p>\n<p>I believe bionic senses and organs is an idea that needs to be put out there – hopefully someone, somewhere finds it not insane enough to act out on it.</p>\n<p>Reinvent the world by reinventing its inherent weakness.

He frantically tried to chase him but there was no car. He was fortunate enough to have a family member be in Batroun at the time of the theft. That person immediately called the police hotline 112 as he chased the motorcycle driver on the Lebanese highway.</p>\n<p>The police informed him that he was not allowed to ram his car into the motorcycle and that he should let them know where he was driving at all times. So he told them when he passed the Mseilha Citadel. He told them when he passed Chekka. He told them when he passed Anfeh.</p>\n<p>He kept his phone to his ear and spoke to the policemen on the other end thinking or maybe hoping that they’d do something. Slightly south of Tripoli, at the Punto Alto side street, the biker disappeared.</p>\n<p>The drive from Batroun to Tripoli took about 20 minutes during which the police was more than informed about the chase taking place. And they still didn’t set up an impromptu checkpoint on the highway to stop the thief, which we would all agree is not highly unusual given their Beiruti practices at random hours of the A.M.</p>\n<p>As a result of our super qualified policemen, the $7000 motorcycle is now in the hands of some gang in Tripoli who, I’m sorry to disappoint you, is not made up of Syrian nationals.</p>\n<p>How do I know this? Well, the plot thickens.</p>\n<p>During the past week, more than eighteen similar motorcycles were stolen in the coastal Batrouni town of Kfaraabida which many of you know for its beaches and Pierre & Friends. The police were, obviously, informed of the grand theft. After all, we were talking about eighteen motorcycles. But they obviously didn’t do anything about it.</p>\n<p>However, not all of those motorcycles remained stolen. Some people whose bikes had been taken away got in contact with people in Tripoli who had contacts in those gangs. They set up an exchange: a decent sum of money for their motorcycle. So they kind of purchased back their bike.</p>\n<p>The man whose bike was stolen went on the same route. He hasn’t gotten back his bike yet but he’ll know soon enough if there’s a chance to retrieve it or if it has already been shipped to Syria.</p>\n<p>Of course, this isn’t new when it comes to our police. A few years ago, my physician uncle woke up in the middle of the night in our Achrafieh apartment to a ruckus in the street. He went to the balcony to see someone breaking into a store at the base of our building.</p>\n<p>My uncle’s knee-jerk reaction was to call the cops. A few attempts later, a sleepy person replied and asked my uncle to call again if the thief came back. Because that obviously makes perfect sense. So as the thief filled up his car with whatever he could find in that store, there was nothing my uncle could do. What if the thief had a knife or a gun? It’s not our job to do what policemen should have been doing at that point.</p>\n<p>I don’t expect anything from our policemen. Maybe a checkpoint that actually serves a tangible purpose. Or trying to intercept one of those money-for-bike exchanges so maybe, just maybe, we could feel safer. Until then, which should be until forever, hide your cars, hide your bikes, hide your precious belongings. It’s the wild wild west over here. But no matter what you do, don’t call the cops.

I showed him around as much as I could given the short time I had, taking myself to Tyre for the first time in my life. I had never been that far South before. I left him there in order for him to see life in that Southern city firsthand. A couple of days later, we met up in Beirut and somehow he started contrasting and comparing my country with his. He comes from one of the world’s biggest superpowers so it’s understandable that my country is lacking in comparison.</p>\n<p>But I couldn’t take it. Snarkiness started to ooze out of every word I uttered like the sharp blade of a knife. Jabs here and there about how his country could never – ever – have the history that my country has started flowing. I even surprised myself when it comes to political declarations which would probably get any Lebanese who knows me turn his head in disbelief. Imagine me proclaiming support for Hezbollah and you’ll get the drift.</p>\n<p>I felt it was necessary. It’s not about being politically correct. It’s this built in sensor inside my brain to defend Lebanon whenever I can to whoever I can. And it goes off at random times, despite the logical part of me telling me that I should probably stop. I can’t help it. My relationship with my country is that of some serious love-hate. And I can’t escape it.</p>\n<p><em>Bref</em>, I nag too much sometimes and I know it. I know some of you hate it – but living in Lebanon leaves you constantly angry, constantly furious, constantly edgy. We all deal with it with the best way we can and considering what we’re dealt with every day, I daresay we handle it really well. Most of the time at least.</p>\n<p>To those who thought I’m being quite negative, you’re probably right. This one’s for you. Now smile and take it in because such articles will only come rarely. Let it sink in because you won’t hear me saying this very often – not that it matters since it’s now online for everyone to see – but here it goes: I probably wouldn’t trade growing up in Lebanon for anything else in the whole world.</p>\n<p>It’s not about the copious amount of money I could have had. It’s not about super kickass passports I often wish I possessed. I think growing up here, witnessing the struggles of here, dealing with the hardships that here represents have gotten me to grow as a person in ways that any other place probably wouldn’t have provided.</p>\n<p>In a way, growing up here has made me a person who is capable of standing on his feet wherever you throw him. It might sound cliche – positive vibes always go around clicheville – but it’s something that the past year has truly reinforced in me.</p>\n<p>When I was in France, the French were shocked I could juggle three languages fluently without a hitch, something that was completely normal to me but seemed very odd to them. It is there that I came to appreciate exactly how thankful I am for the decent education I got here. The fact that I was able to keep up with more knowledgeable physicians at the hospital where I did my clerkship doesn’t only reflect on my mental capacities but on the way education in Lebanon shapes you up without you even knowing it. It is no wonder that with all the preparation we subtly get in school and later on in higher education institutes, we are able to excel when given room and opportunity.</p>\n<p>That month I spent in France opened up my eyes to something else that I hadn’t really thought of: life in Lebanon does not go on in a protective bubble that separates you from everything else happening around you.<br>\nThe aforementioned idea started to get formulated in my mind back in 2011 when I wrote a small article about 9/11 and some members of American family stopped talking to me as a result. I still don’t see anything wrong with my article. If anything, I stand by it more than before. But it’s the perception of the article which differentiates my American kin from yours truly. For them, I am being harsh and insensitive because I haven’t lived it and I am not American. To me, they are being very concentric and limited. But it’s no one’s fault really: my perception as a Lebanese of the world is and will always be of people whose fate isn’t in their hand, of a country which is always a part in a chessgame of bigger fish.<br>\nAnd while we nag about that as is our right, I think the premise of the life this sets is healthy: to know that there’s always another story taking place somewhere, to know that there is another side to us, to know that there is life form outside of the bubble that we love to live inside and to know that everything has a reference point to put things in perspective.</p>\n<p>The photographer who came here back in December was more than interested in something that I not only took for granted but thought was beyond normal. My hometown coexists quite peacefully with a neighboring Shiite town. My best friends happen to be either Shiite or atheists or Sunni or Maronites. We differ politically, we argue more often than not. We come from severely different backgrounds in our own country. But we still find ourselves at one table having dinner as often as we argue about the backgrounds from which we come. The experience itself is one that we ignore because it’s never in the forefront of our thoughts. But to an outsider, the interactions we have and the friendships we strike are things that are beyond interesting. When that photographer pointed out how odd to him that dinner table setting was, I started to think about it more and I realized that I am what I am today because of those people that have come into my life from all those different backgrounds. And despite some eccentric bearded men from all sides wanting to tell us that our friendships are abnormal, our relationships still exist and they keep flourishing. The majority of us as Lebanese have friends who come from backgrounds that had, until quite recently in historical terms, been fighting against each other. Yet that’s never an issue. It’s not even something we think about. But imagine how bland our lives would be if the only people we knew shared our thoughts, our views and barely differed from us in the things that count.</p>\n<p>And as I go back home every day from class or from those dinners with friends, another thing I take for granted is my family. The fact that the family unit is still very cohesive in this country is a treasure in itself. Child psychology tells you how important a tightly-knit family is for the development of a human being. But this isn’t about psychological theories. How often do we think about the warm meal awaiting us back home which our grandmother or mother more than willingly cooked for us, along with a warm hug because even though they had last seen us a few hours prior they miss us terribly?<br>\nAnd I don’t meant this in a sexist manner for those feminists gearing up for international women’s day. How often do we think about that awesome person we call grandpa who, as he grows up, becomes more kind hearted than a five year old boy? Or how about those siblings of ours that we love to hate but can’t imagine living without? Or those cousins we keep bickering with and the aunts and uncles who raised them? How about our fathers who, despite their strong facade, love us to the moon and back?<br>\nThe family unit in Lebanon is not restricted to the parents and siblings. It transcends them to anyone who shares your family name. And we pretend that it aggravates us off when families gather in certain occasions. But the truth is that our family, including those extended members we don’t like to think about, act as a firm ground for us to stand in troubled times. And they do that without us asking for it.</p>\n<p>Life in Lebanon sets you up to be a great individual when given the framework to allow such greatness to unfold. It makes you more aware of the world. It gives you a rich cultural experience to start from. It gives you a strong educational package to build a life upon and gives you a sense of belonging that makes you prone to find anchor wherever you’re thrown. It saddens me to say that I will probably leave this place someday because the future might be bleak. And I lose hope in it sometimes and I rekindle it at other times despite my better judgement. But it remains that being Lebanese is something that makes me proud. It is something that I believe has offered me the essential that makes human beings shine and make a life for themselves. That life probably won’t happen here. But that life will forever owe itself to here.</p>\n<p>Cheers to all those Lebanese perks we keep taking for granted.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/lebanon/">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/life-2/">Life</a> Tagged: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/911/">9/11</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/coexistence/">coexistence</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/diversity/">diversity</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/education/">Education</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lebanon/">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/life/">life</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/religion/">Religion</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/6806/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=6806&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

The initiative was launched back in October, 2012 when the Minister of Telecommunication signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Intel’s John Davies at Beirut’s Digital District in the presence of the Minister of Education .</p>\n<p>Now the big news I managed to get my hands on is that all parties involved have put the MOU into action and the official commencement of the project was yesterday, March 4th, 2013. In fact pre-orders of the tablets can be placed starting TODAY!</p>\n<p><strong>THIS PROJECT IS A BIG DEAL & HERE ARE 5 REASONS WHY<br></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><em>1) Good news, against the odds!</em></span></strong></p>\n<p>How many times have we heard of projects, or plans in Lebanon that have fallen through? Too many to mention. So when I first heard about this, I too reverted to my original Lebanese nature and was skeptic. But skeptic or not, this is happening. 15,000 tablets of good quality, good content, good security measures and good prices will be in the hands of Lebanese students sooner than anyone had anticipated. For a country that is troubled by turmoil and smothered by hidden agendas, this is a breath of fresh air.</p>\n<p><em><strong>2) A much-needed precedence</strong></em></p>\n<p>The Ministry of Telecommunications and The Ministry of Education, are working together in ONE PROJECT! Was it all smooth and dandy, I am sure it was not, but they got this far. This means with the right people, the right agenda and the right way, collaboration across different ministries and governmental agencies can be a reality. A beneficial reality! Now this is not the first initiative in the region, Dubai’s Government launched and funded a <a href="http://www.khda.gov.ae/en/news/khdanews.aspx?ID=24649">Smart Learning initiative</a> back in August 2012 to have tablets delivered to students of public schools by 2017. The difference however is how BOTH the public sector (MOE, MOT, Central Bank) and the private sector (Intel, Triple C, Alfa, Touch, Blom Bank, Liban Post) in Lebanon came together to implement this project and meet the objective of having “all secondary public school students gain access to tablets by 2014.” as put by the Minister of Education Dr. Diab.</p>\n<p><em><strong>3) Finally REAL CSR!</strong></em></p>\n<p>I am not against organizations giving out cheques for charity, running marathons, providing free meals, adding the 1000 LBP to the bills, planting trees and all that jazz. In fact, I commend them and appreciate what they are doing. But, Corporate Social Responsibility IS NOT CHARITY! It is a business commitment to a measurable process that will bring positive SUSTAINABLE IMPACT to all members of the community. All the private sector companies involved in this initiative have a made a commitment, will invest resources, build processes and measure impact to transform the Lebanese community at different levels, from students, to educators to institutions.  This initiative is not a business case of a multinational organization. CSR best practices are right here in our field and the Lebanese private sector wants to play the game.</p>\n<p><em><strong>4) A tablet for the Lebanese by the Lebanese</strong></em></p>\n<p>Beyond the patriotic talk, these tablet will be produced in Lebanon, 15000 of them and with a market estimated at <a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2012/Pages/youth-tablets.aspx">half a million youth</a>, there is a solid chance for economic growth. This can and probably will mean more jobs, the development of new tech-related skill sets, the surfacing of a new educational apps and software market right here in Lebanon. Will this particular project turn Lebanon into the Silicone Valley of the Middle East, NO! but it is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p><em><strong>5) A project for the ones that really matter.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I am sure some of you (yes you know who you are) will be skeptic about the project, the ministries, touch, Alfa, etc. And just like any other project, anywhere in the world, there are risks, and there will be flaws. But this project is NOT about you. This is about students, a slice of society who have long been marginalized and ignored across Lebanon. No one involves them in their own education, and hardly has there been any efforts to truly prep them from a young age to think creatively, develop their talents and more importantly their sense of citizenship. Any student, from Akaar, to Nabatieh, from a public school or a private one, will be  enabled to learn from, innovate and connect with other students and educators anywhere in Lebanon, and the world. Just imagine the possibilities!  Lebanese social and cultural silos dissolving and leaving nothing but talented innovative young individuals as the next profile of Lebanese citizens.</p>\n<p>Sending this endeavor loads of support and positive energy and Lebanese students and educators loads of respect and admiration,</p>\n<p>From Hamra,</p>\n<p>Hope over and out</p>\n<span><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TdDlnxyHzCI?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span>\n<p>For more details on the initiative check out <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/education-solutions/lebanon-open-your-tomorrow.html?wapkw=lebanon">Intel </a> and for more details on the Tablet’s specs check out <a href="http://www.triplec.com.lb/newsdetails.aspx?pageid=76">Triple C </a></p>\n'),

I asked him for a glass of wine and a vodka 7up for my friend. He looked like I just swore at him.</p>\n<p><strong>Waiter</strong>(with the heaviest French accent I’ve heard in Dubai): <em>“Darling, come on, wine? Really? Our specialty are cocktails, let me do something special for you, filled with love, with wine I just open z bottle and poooor z wine where is the fun there huh?”</em></p>\n<p><strong>Moi:</strong> (Giggle)<em>“No really I’d like some wine”</em></p>\n<p>We went back and forth around 3 times.

But there is not that 7up in zis place okii? Really, no 7up”</em></p>\n<p><strong>Moi:</strong>“Just give me the closest thing to 7up”</p>\n<p>He hands me Vodka- something and goes on to ignore me for the rest of the evening. The experience wouldn’t have been complete had he not done so. Almost as though he had been planted my management to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>The place was jam-packed and it was only a Tuesday. We were seated on a roundtable with a couple of tomatoes, a lemon and a bottle off love oil in the centre.</p>\n<p>We started things off with a fresh and crisp dish salad called Taboulet de Quinoa Salad which I thoroughly enjoyed; it had a very light barely-there dressing that allowed the quinao to stand out.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-7.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 7" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-7-e1362515258473.jpg?w=500&h=621" width="500" height="621"></a></p>\n<p>The Carpacio de Boeuf was one of the best I’ve had in a long time, it’s basically cured sirloin with this magnificent pickle dressing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-5.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 5" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-5-e1362515422976.jpg?w=500&h=520" width="500" height="520"></a></p>\n<p>But the appetizer that stole my heart was the Burrata et Tomates  a marvelous fresh Italian cheese, somewhere between a mozzarella and one of the richest creams you will encounter. It fell apart as soon as it came into contact with my spoon and felt like velvet in my mouth. I wanted to hold onto it just a little while longer before the moment was over.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-3.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 3" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-3-e1362515468893.jpg?w=500&h=408" width="500" height="408"></a></p>\n<p>We also tried the Salad of Green Lentils and Calamars Frits which were quite spicy, both were was nothing out of the ordinary but added that Mediterranean touch the place promised.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-4.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 4" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-4.jpg?w=500&h=378" width="500" height="378"></a></p>\n<p>And now for the fun part, the main course, I sunk my fangs into a the succulent dish of Côte de Veau Grillée (grilled veal chops) which were astoundingly  tender with a no-fuss marination or sauce- not even a side dish- just right to the point. And with veal like that, that’s really all you need.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-8.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 8" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-8-e1362515572432.jpg?w=500&h=626" width="500" height="626"></a></p>\n<p>I also got to try the Coquelet au Citron Confit, a slow roasted baby chicken with lemon and it was as succulent as promised. I’m not a big fan of chicken  but this was not your average bird.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-10.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 10" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-10.jpg?w=500&h=516" width="500" height="516"></a></p>\n<p>And finally the Ziti with black truffles in a very light creamy sauce, and although I usually like my pastas drowned in juices, there was something about the subtle yet thick cream that made this dish just as good for me. I recommend you go for this one as a side dish but never as a main course, you’d miss out on so much more.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-9.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 9" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-9-e1362515890163.jpg?w=500&h=613" width="500" height="613"></a></p>\n<p>And of course no French meal is complete without Pain Perdu and Crème Brulée. I lost myself in the warm Pain Perdu that came with spice cinnamon-like ice cream. It was fulfilling in ways I just can’t describe. Really, I can’t. We also washed it all down with some Coconut, Pineapple-Mint, Raspberry, Passion Fruit ice cream.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-11.jpg"><img alt="La Petite Maison Dubai 11" src="http://ivysays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/la-petite-maison-dubai-11-e1362515989490.jpg?w=500&h=340" width="500" height="340"></a></p>\n<p>Aside from the one arrogant French man, I most definitely recommend you experience La Petite Maison on your next visit to Dubai, just don’t order 7up and be prepared to splurge.

A large coffee table book was prominently displayed on the shelf with the title <em>Man’oushé</em>. I remember feeling elated that someone would actually build an entire book over our humble and beloved breakfast flatbread. </span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>This book is yet another remarkable effort: It focuses on Lebanese traditional methods of preserving foods. Mrs. Massaad, ever the intrepid traveler, combed the four corners of the country camera in hand. She recorded with beautiful photographs the tireless efforts of folks intent on preserving the bounty of our Mediterranean land. </strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>This imposing coffee table book (it weighs almost 5 pounds) is chockful of images (including glimpses of the author and her children); it reads like a collection of vignettes capturing here, the preparation of fig molasses, there the harvesting of pine nuts, and hundreds of other such pursuits. </strong></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://tasteofbeirut.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mouneh-3.jpg"><img alt="mouneh-3" src="http://tasteofbeirut.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mouneh-3.jpg" width="600" height="400"></a></p>\n<p><span><strong><span><em>Mouneh</em></span> is the title of this book and it is the word used to describe the Lebanese tradition of preserving foods for the Winter months. I remember my grandmother every year, in Beirut, getting busy with a limited<em> mouneh</em>. She’d pickle cucumbers and turnips and brine olives and dozens of jars would be stored in the attic located in the kitchen. In Ms. Massaad’s oeuvre, one is privy to the mouneh of salt-of-the-earth type of folks in their own private habitat. </strong></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://tasteofbeirut.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mouneh-2.jpg"><img alt="mouneh-2" src="http://tasteofbeirut.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mouneh-2.jpg" width="600" height="400"></a></p>\n<p><span><strong>The book is organized in a sequence of chapters divided into seasons and months; each month includes certain foods or vegetables (or fruits) and their pickling, drying or preserving; traditional foods such as cheeses or various molasses are also covered. In addition the book contains dozens of recipes and tips such as the best way to preserve grape leaves or how to prepare plum paste or watermelon jam.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>In conclusion, this is a book I am glad to have acquired; I will leaf through the pages every now and then for many years to come and even make use of some of these recipes. The photos alone make one feel as if stepping into nature or going on a road trip to a wonderful place. This book encapsulated the best images of Lebanon that one would wish to keep in memory. </strong></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://tasteofbeirut.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mouneh.jpg"><img alt="mouneh" src="http://tasteofbeirut.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mouneh.jpg" width="600" height="400"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n'),

The news went viral. Should we be shocked? I don’t think so.</p>\n<p>Israel’s move in announcing this new bus system, according to Haaretz newspaper, comes as a result of complaints made by Israeli settlers who believe that mixed buses constituted a security risk. Rights groups around Israel and around the world describe the move in one word: racist. Simply put this is just another example of an apartheid policy being used in the illegal occupation of Palestinian land. The key word in this sentence should be “another.”</p>\n<p>Israel, for being the self-proclaimed “only true democracy in the Middle East,” has given us various examples of its forthright racism in the past year. Last year Knesset member Miri Regev described Sudanese and Eritrean refugees as “a cancer in [Israel’s] body.” In May of last year, Israeli Minister Eli Yishai <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/eli-yishai-israeli-women-afraid-to-report-rape-by-african-migrants-due-to-aids-stigma-1.433585">stated</a> that the solution to the current immigration problem is “more prisons and migrant detention camps,” further stating that these “infiltrators, ALONG with the Palestinians, will bring a swift end to the Zionist dream.”</p>\n<p>Whether the comparison is made to racist policies that existed in the US, or apartheid policies in South Africa, there is no denying that Israel continues to convey discriminatory attitudes towards Palestinians.  As a strong supporter of a two-state solution, I believe that this attitude is perhaps the most significant obstacle to any true progress in the region. The fact that these Israeli settlers, already occupying what is legally Palestinian land, felt it reasonable to make such a request makes one thing clear: In their minds, Palestinians are not equals. How can a true peace be built if such opinions exist.</p>\n<p>Add this new trend of segregated bus systems to an existing system of segregated roads, hundreds of checkpoints, a Ministry of Education with civics lessons that go as far as to discourage relations between Jewish girls and Arab boys, and a ridiculously insulting and backward take on immigration. The fact that these racist ideas are so often being made by the most influential of Israeli figures is a sign of increased public acceptance of those ideas.</p>\n<p>Obviously, in no way is this indication that all Israelis are racist. On the contrary, much of the criticism of this segregated bus system is coming from Israeli human rights organizations. It is our role in highlighting these organizations and raising their voices that will overshadow racist remarks such as those aforementioned.</p>\n<p>The one organization that shone through my research was B’Tselem. Check out their website: <a href="http://www.btselem.org/">http://www.btselem.org/</a></p>\n<p>Also, if you haven’t watched the Oscar nominated documentary 5 Broken Cameras, do so ASAP. I leave you with some optimism: check out the effect it had on the Israeli students who watched it.</p>\n<p><span><iframe width="474" height="297" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i1wEszQYEzg?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Until next time…</p>\n<p> </p>\n'),

He also quotes from the first two of a six-part series on “today’s Iraq” penned by <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ten-years-on-from-the-war-how-the-world-forgot-about-iraq-8518490.html"><span>Patrick Cockburn for <i>The Independent</i></span></a>.</span></div>\n<div><i><span>According to Cockburn:</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>Iraq is disintegrating as a country under the pressure of a mounting political, social and economic crisis, Iraqi leaders say.</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>They add that 10 years after the U.S, invasion and occupation the conflict between the three main communities – Shiite, Sunnite and Kurd – is deepening to a point just short of civil war...</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>The record of failure of post-Saddam governments, given the financial resources available, is astounding. One of the reasons many Iraqis welcomed the fall of Saddam in 2003, whatever their feelings about foreign occupation, was that they thought his successors would restore normal life after years of sanctions and war. To their astonishment and fury this has not happened, though Iraq now enjoys $100bn a year in oil revenues. In Baghdad there is scarcely a new civilian building to be seen and most of the new construction is heavily fortified police or military outposts. In Basra, at the heart of the oilfields, there are pools of sewage and heaps of uncollected rubbish in the streets on which herds of goats forage...</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>Theft of public money and incompetence on a gargantuan scale means the government fails to provide adequate electricity, clean water or sanitation. One-third of the labor force is unemployed and, when you include those under-employed, the figure is over half. Even those who do have a job have often obtained it by bribery...</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>The rule of Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister since 2006, has become a near dictatorship with highly developed means of repression, such as secret prisons, and pervasive use of torture. He has sought to monopolize control over the army, intelligence service, government apparatus and budget, making sure that his supporters get the lion’s share of jobs and contracts...</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>As the pre-eminent leader of the Shiites, three-fifths of the population, he alarms them by suggesting that their political dominance is under threat from the Sunni, a fifth of Iraqis, once in charge under Saddam but now marginalized. Last year, Maliki sought to unite Sunnite and Shiite Arabs against the Kurds, another fifth of the population, by massing troops and threatening to invade Kurdish-controlled but disputed areas.</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>The Sunni had suffered shattering defeats with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the formation of a Shiite-Kurdish government and loss of the sectarian civil war. But the conflict in Syria marked a change for the better in Sunni fortunes. They have been emboldened by the bid for power of Syria’s Sunni majority just across the border from their own heartlands in Anbar and Nineveh provinces...</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>Maliki may employ a million men in different branches of the Iraqi security forces. In most countries this would guarantee government control, but in practice Maliki only has full authority in about half the national territory. He has no power in the northern third of the country held by the Kurds and increasingly limited influence in Sunni areas...</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>A few months before the invasion, an Iraqi civil servant secretly interviewed in Baghdad made a gloomy forecast. “The exiled Iraqis are the exact replica of those who currently govern us… with the sole difference that the latter are already satiated since they have been robbing us for the past 30 years,” he said. “Those who accompany the U.S. troops will be ravenous.”</span></i></div>\n<div><i><span>Many of the Iraqis who came back to Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion were people of high principle who had sacrificed much as opponents of Saddam Hussein. But fast-forward 10 years and the prediction of the unnamed civil servant about the rapacity of Iraq’s new governors turns out to have been all too true. As one former minister puts it, “the Iraqi government is an institutionalized kleptocracy”…</span></i></div>\n<div><span>Last week, Harfouche recalls, Maliki warned that a victory for the opposition in Syria would lead to “a civil war in Lebanon, divisions in Jordan and a sectarian conflict in Iraq.” His warning echoed Assad’s earlier threat – namely, that sparks from his regime’s fall would ignite the entire region.</span></div>\n<div><span>Harfouche says the alarming trade-off being proposed is this: we [Assad and Maliki] shall keep the peace in Syria, Iraq and the entire region if you let us keep our sectarian hold on power in Damascus and Baghdad.</span></div>\n<div><span>“If truth be told,” Harfouche writes, “what risks destabilizing Iraq is its prime minister’s prejudiced meddling in the Syria crisis and his piloting the de-structuring of Iraq through corruption and the exclusion of large numbers of Iraqi Sunnites and Kurds from public office and the decision-making process.</span></div>\n<div><span>“The Americans can’t be blamed for backing Nouri al-Maliki’s rise to power.

Before even hitting the show, just by looking at the card we can get a feel of the collection. In fact, the card is a very colorful aerial shot of the show’s location, the Jardin des Tuileries. This show was inspired by the patterns and colors of landscapes as seen from the sky: fields of golden wheat, dark green forests, mirrored lakes, etc. I am literally in love with this collection. There’s nothing that has more hope, more happiness and movement than colors and very light fabrics for contrasting cold winters. The live music by the Open Reel Ensemble was very good and added a lot to the graphism of the show; as the band composes music using reel-to-reel tape decks combined with live samplings of voices and sounds.</span><br><span>From the checkered patterns with stripes, to the voluminous outerwear, the multi-color blocked tartan checks and the rich colors for wool and angora coats, it felt like a very warm, confortable yet fresh winter. My favorite part were the colorful accents on pockets and collars, the printed wide legged pants and skirts, the two-tone knit tops and the flared skirts. Everything was there for a really good collection!</span></p>\n<div>\n<a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0435.jpg" rel="lightbox[10102]"><img title="DSC_0435"

House music is unrivaled in my mind, and its many shades and flavors are the key ingredient to any good night, drive, chill and of course party. Uberhaus has the word house in it, plus uber, so naturally, it’s bound to be my kind of place.</p>\n<p>I missed the opening and first 6 months while I was away, but as soon as I was back, I was at Uber and it has been two weekends now partying there with a third one definitely on the way.</p>\n<p>The closing down of The Basement and the difficult hours of B018 made quality house music limited to party crew events every now and then. But, that lacked the consistency and certainty you need to plan out your weekends properly revolving around a kickass party with kickass music and kickass people. Uberhaus has finally become home, and we are no longer homeless when it comes to weekend nights.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/150925_361212283977987_1132855309_n.jpg"><img alt="150925_361212283977987_1132855309_n" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/150925_361212283977987_1132855309_n.jpg?w=300&h=200" width="300" height="200"></a>Fat Dutch, Romax, Richard Kahwagi, Ronin and Nesta, Phil and CAB are the residents there and switch between nights of Romax and Friends (Romax), Groove Republic (Ronin and Nesta and Phil), Inocuous (Fat Dutch) and Katapult (Richie). This absolutely mind-blowing lineup of resident DJs, all of whom are extremely good friends, aren’t the only talents which grace the decks under the custom-built LED light wall though. Every week, talents from Lebanon and across the world including giants like M.A.N.D.Y. spin their stuff and make the venue earn its name of Uberhaus.</p>\n<p>The club is underground and has the beautiful beton-brute, underground feel to it which is littered with furniture, wallpaper and decorations that seem straight out of the Baroque. On one side runs a bar, on the other a series of couches and tables on an elevated platform. On one end is the DJ booth and on the other is a wider area with more tables for when the club gets a higher than average tidal wave of revelers.</p>\n<p>There are a few perks you might not immediately catch on to so I’ll tell you here. On your way to the bathrooms, there’s a wall that will be riddled with lollipops of different shapes and sizes. Grab one, for free, before they run out. Another thing I absolutely <em>love</em> is that water is for free. Last Friday, I asked for a bottle of water and got one, with no bill. This is awesome, and I really love a club which offers water for free that’ll help water down your blood alcohol levels and keep you hydrated and ready to dance till the wee hours of the morning (EDIT: the water isn’t officially free, it depends on how lucky you are with the people behind the bar and how drunk you are. Sorry guys about the inaccurate information EDIT 2: after the guys at Uberhaus saw the review and that you guys would love the free water idea, it’s official, water is now free at Uber!). Last but not least, if you come before 11:00PM, entrance is free!</p>\n<p>The music is sublime. I am sure you all know most of the DJs and have partied to their sets before. Imagine what it’d be like combining them all under one roof every Friday and Saturday. Beautiful, deep house, tech-house, nu-disco and indie dance and all the subtle nuances and flavors of the 123-128bpm variety (the best, ever).</p>\n<p>All in all, Uberhaus is uberawesome. I loved it and was definitely not disappointed after building up hype for it for half a year! It’s virtually a certainty I’ll be there every Friday and Saturday to be part of this movement, not just a club, of good music, good people and <em>real </em>parties, the kind where no one drowns in make-up, douchy silk shirts and 21 centimeter heels.</p>\n<p>Check out their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uberhausclub">Facebook page</a> for schedules, awesome photos, the sets and custom pages

It’s an old renovated house situated in an isolated area from the vibrant Gouraud street. Once you go in, there’s a large room with a bar on the left, high tables and chairs, cool chandeliers dangling from the roof and Botero paintings on the wall. There are other rooms more suited for relaxing and dining but you will be missing out on a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/images/20130223_235443-425x318.jpg" alt="20130223_235443" width="425" height="318"><br><em>Fat Monalisa</em></p>\n<p>Even though we got there early, the place was already half full but tables were comfortably distanced from each other and from the bar. Once we sat down, we were offered Champagne glasses for some reason. I thought it was a welcome drink or something but it turned out to be “Champagne Saturday” where everyone gets Champagne every time the bell rings.  </p>\n<p><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/images/20130223_220458-425x318.jpg" alt="20130223_220458" width="425" height="318"></p>\n<p>We ordered drinks and Nachos first, then The Mansion burger, a Mozzarella sandwich and a Breast N Cheese platter as main dishes. Everything tasted great and the service was impeccable. I don’t want to be exaggerating here but the girl (Rachel) in charge of our table was just great and made the whole experience even better. She’d check on us every 5-10 minutes to make sure our drinks are as requested or if we needed a refill, whether our food is delivered on time, or if we needed anything at all. I will suggest to the Mansion people that they name her employee of the month and add a funny painting of her similar to the ones they have displayed.</p>\n<p><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/images/20130223_222430-425x318.jpg" alt="20130223_222430" width="425" height="318"></p>\n<p>Moving on to the music, the DJ created a nice ambiance, far from trance and cheap commercial songs, and included some awesome songs from the 90s like Scatman or Cotton Eyed Joe. There weren’t a lot of people dancing when we left (Around 12:30) but the place was packed and everybody seemed to be having a good time. More importantly, no one was smoking inside. </p>\n<p>Price-wise, the bill was reasonable and we ended up paying around 40$ per person.</p>\n<p><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/images/20130223_235540-425x318.jpg" alt="20130223_235540" width="425" height="318"></p>\n<p>To sum it up, I had a great time at The Mansion and I will be visiting back soon to try the Pork Ribs. </p>\n'),

The campaign stress on the unexpected feel that trident can give, and how out of the box the product can be.</p>\n<p>It’s a spot on adaptation of the international concept, though it might have been pushed way more if shot at a regular Beiruti area, a busy pop scene, that’s a bit less ‘tantes sursock’/beautiful neighborhoods!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/brofessionalreview.wordpress.com/2515/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/brofessionalreview.wordpress.com/2515/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=brofessionalreview.com&blog=28964988&post=2515&subd=brofessionalreview&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

If you’re a student or employee, chances are you never have time to get to the bank before 2:00PM and wait in line. Also, who the hell wants to wake up early and get to the bank before noon on Saturdays. Also, no offense to any bank employees, whom many of my close friends are, but I’d much rather get the job done myself at my own convenience and any time of day with everything clear on a good old computer screen.</p>\n<p>Just the other night, while on my way to Uruguay street, I stopped by the LED-Christmas-tree-like Bank Audi branch in Dbayeh and deposited some cash I didn’t want on me. It took less than 3 minutes and problem-free. Just put in your debit card, place the money all-at-once without any rubber band, envelope, or paper clip, with the US presidents facing you, and you’re all set. It asks you if the amount is right before confirming the deposit, and ta-da, you’re done.</p>\n<p>I loved it, and the less trips and line-waiting at the bank, the better. Also, I’d much rather do things myself and see everything on the screen instead of communicating verbally with everyone around. I mean, what if you’re sorta broke and don’t want the entire branch knowing how little (or if you’re lucky, how much) you’re depositing in your bank-secrecy-protected Lebanese account.</p>\n<p>Here are a few shots of the ATM I used. I hope all ATMs and banks become like this in the near future, and mobile banking becomes more ubiquitous and has more functions than it does today.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>One thing I forgot (and didn’t know) is that when you go to the branch to deposit, the “value date” or when the money becomes available is 4 days. When you deposit in the ATM, it’s just 1 day. So, even more reason why this is awesome which I didn’t even know about.

Now Hizbullah. Why are there only failed attempts at uprooting that bad plant? I mean, they did come from outer space (like all the other predecessors) after all? What can Israel or the US, the indegeneous, do to fix this problem? They did try everything after all…</p>\n<p>If, “<a href="http://www.mepc.org/about-council">The Middle East Policy Council</a> is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to contribute to American understanding of the political, economic and cultural issues that affect U.S. interests in the Middle East”, then it’s quite understandable that finding that “rootedness” is a resilient attribute of the link between Hizbullah to its people can pose a big problem!</p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4502/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/remarkz.wordpress.com/4502/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=remarkz.wordpress.com&blog=3584669&post=4502&subd=remarkz&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

So, after it’s relaunch and an awesome Friday night there with Nour, Mari-Joe, Celina, Fida, Samer, Karim, Gaelle and Hashem I decided it’s time for this long-overdue review of perhaps my favorite Gemmayzeh venue.</p>\n<p>Alcazar is located on the St. Nicolas Stairs, famous for the continuous art galleries, installations and festivals that happen on this historic staircase that connects the vibrant Gouraud Street with the truly magical Sursock Street, home to some of Beirut’s most beautiful and well-preserved traditional mansions and palaces. Alcazar blended in with its environment perfectly, and more so now that they have their very own art space where you can feature your work for free.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/316028_295656220463901_2123890160_n.jpg"><img alt="316028_295656220463901_2123890160_n" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/316028_295656220463901_2123890160_n.jpg?w=300&h=200" width="300" height="200"></a>Alcazar is a three-floor, refurbished traditional Lebanese house that incorporates beautiful Lebanese stone masonry with the more modern steel and concrete minimal design. The ground floor is where we spend most of our time, where there’s a bar that runs along on one side with a few high tables sandwiched between the bar and the DJ booth and an elevator shaft that leads up to the two other floors. This area has been left untouched (thankfully, cause I liked it) and the relaunch has instead revamped the outer terrace, which is much-needed now for smokers who aren’t lighting up indoors (thank you!) and step out to find a cool swing and patio furniture to have a chat where the music is less loud and smoke a cigarette before heading back in.</p>\n<p>The first floor is the art gallery, and within two weeks, the first showcase will be up and running. I’d really love to see one of you guys and gals put your photos, paintings, sculptures or any other piece of art there, so make sure you contact them and see what you need to do (it is free though, I asked twice). The roof terrace also remains a surprise, since it’s still wintery and not open yet. But, it’s a really chill section with comfortable couches and a much more laid-back, loungy feel to it than the ground floor. It’s perfect for drinks and a dinner as the sun is setting and I’d suggest continuing the rest of your night downstairs on the ground floor for some good, beautiful House music.</p>\n<p>The music is usually different shades of House and electronic music with talents like Ronin and Nesta, Fat Dutch and Diamond Setter being regulars there last summer. Residents after the relaunch include Diamond Setter, Lady Bug, Dansz, Trix and Justine Baer. Of course, there might be theme nights every now and then for all you people who aren’t as hardcore House lovers as I am, so you might wanna look into that =P</p>\n<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Location and venue</strong>: Out-of-the-way, nice underground venue yet still in the heart of Gemmayzeh on the St. Nicolas Stairs<br><strong>Music:</strong> A variety of electronic music (house, nudisco, indie)<br><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Chill, laidback and sophisticated<br><strong>Wheelchair accessible</strong>: No<br><strong>Staff</strong>: Friendly and courteous<br><strong>Smoking:</strong> Indoors, no (thankfully).

This year, Claudine exceeded my expectations when it came to the quality of the materials she used, the mood of the collection, and the cuts she chose. </span><br><span> The fashion show took place in her gorgeous Parisian showroom, with gold details on the walls and huge chandeliers. </span><br><span> Most of the looks were in black with a couple of red outfits, some metallic gold details and a white short dress closing the show. As for the fabrics used,there was such a wide variety with everything from leather, wool, lace, crepe georgette to chiffon and tulle. The collection celebrated the strong modern woman; sexy when she’s all suited for work and extremely elegant for a dinner date. The models had slicked back hair in a ponytail with dark red lipstick.

To give a fair hearing to the Minister, I will republish his comment as its own post below.</em></p>\n<p><img alt="" src="http://beirutspring.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/w460.jpg"></p>\n<p>Thanks Mustapha for this useful reminder to Lebanese entrepreneurs that nothing comes without hard work, sustained effort and perseverance. Of course the competition didn’t hint to the contrary. It is just intended to steer creativity and imagination. They have a virtue in themselves. I will mention three that come to my mind.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To remind us of the power of ideas. I will refer you to <a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2013/Pages/telecom-revive.aspx">my AUB speech</a> which had the objective of unleashing the power of our youth’s minds.</li>\n<li>To force us to think beyond our borders, our physical limitations because a small country like ours can be one of the main beneficiary of this new geography where any point in the world can be its center.</li>\n<li>It will help us regain much needed assurance and self-confidence because contrary to what you said I do believe Lebanese have strong points in which they are better than other people. I do think that some of their promoted strong points which helps them succeed abroad are in fact some of the ingredients that destroy the country here at home. Their sense of trade, their ability to adapt, etc. All traits that diminish their national identity and their willingness to build a strong state. But what I am sure of, and more so since I took the helm of the telecom sector, is that they have a unique talent for creativity. Look around and notice: the best cloth designers if the Middle east are Lebanese, the best jewelry designers, most of creative in ad agencies are Lebanese, first cooks, hairdressers etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It could be a way of the universal balance to give us something positive out of the fact that it made us a crossroad of religions, sects, languages and invaders. Let’s not waste it. In the digital world, the digital village it could be a plus that can help us outshine others countries and we badly need this edge.</p>\n<p>The other thing worth mentioning is that making Lebanon a digital hub has this fantastic benefit that instead of exporting our people we will be giving our local brains a chance to work from Lebanon and sell their products and services to the whole planet from right here. Dermandar (6 million downloads) and Pou (25 million downloads) are good examples that it is possible. It’s the fastest way to reverse the vicious cycle of emigration (economie de la rente).</p>\n<p>Last, let me insist on the virtue of positive approach. I know it’s tough in a country like ours where things seem out of our control and where the disproportion of force between local will and international players seem impossible to beat because of a deeply divided political spectrum. It’s tough but it’s possible. Its more than possible it is necessary or else why would we stay? Where would hope lie. We have to believe it’s possible and we have to try and make it work. That’s the positive attitude. That’s what drives me every day in the morning to get out of bed and face the infinite dangers and minefields of the political and administrative arena.</p>\n<p>For me it’s this or abandon our fate to the bad guys and accept that we cannot but move backwards. Although the country is at a halt in almost every aspect and the government have difficulty governing we leapfrogged in the telecommunication field. This is due to a resolute attitude, refusing to accept anything that would stop the necessary changes and the infrastructure improvements. Just remember that 2 years ago we use to wait half an hour to download 1Mega Bytes of emails. And there is much more to come. Of course it would be easier if all political parties and figures would accept to sideline telecommunications from the political struggle. It would also help if all citizen’s from all political or non-political sides would support the important infrastructure upgrades.</p>\n<p>I believe we should have a willful pragmatic approach.

I happen to think that this has been a very ineffective\ncabinet and that the time for a change is way overdue. But one should not\nexpect a cabinet to resign only because the opposition says so during press\nconferences only. There is a legitimate parliamentary procedure to be followed\nif and when any of the 128 members of the Chamber wishes to call for vote of\nconfidence in the cabinet as a whole. March 14, unfortunately has chosen not to\nfollow that path but instead to use the press to release statements that are\nneither effective nor meaningful. </span>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\n<span>If Mr.\nSaniora wants us to really believe that he is the reasonable leader of a large\nbloc of representatives in the Chamber then the least he could do is challenge\nthe cabinet in a vote of confidence, even one that his group cannot win. It is\nthe nature of these challenges that will keep the cabinet as a whole and each\nof its individual members sensitive to the demands and needs of the others in\nthe state. The same logic, obviously, would demand nothing less than that by\nMr. Geagea and his Lebanese Forces if they are truly dissatisfied with the\npolicies and the programs of the present cabinet. As for Sa’ad Hariri, I am\nafraid that he has given up the right to either head a new cabinet or even lead\na major bloc. Someone should remind Mr. Hariri that he got his chance and his\nperformance was and still is way below par.

This means that nothing,\nabsolutely nothing, can justify not holding elections at the date specified by\nlaw.<span>  </span>One of the most sacrosanct\nprinciples in the rule of law is to abide by the details of the law as\nprescribed. These major institutional decisions are not to be handled casually\nby changing them whenever one desires. Laws are to be respected and it is the\nduty of governments, to take the constitutional responsibility very seriously.\nUnfortunately very few, if any, in the present cadre of Lebanese politicians\nseems to be up to this major task.</span>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\n<span>The Chamber\nis clearly forbidden from electing to the Presidency an ex Chief of the Army\nbut yet that was exactly what they did without even questioning the\nunconstitutionality of their act. As if that is not enough, they have failed\nfor twenty years to elect a Senate and to deconfesionalize the Chamber as well\nas all positions in the government. Add to the above the fact that the central\ngovernment does not dare exercise its power in certain regions of the country\nnor over some groups. It is not only that they tolerate the challenge to the\ngovernment authority but they even encourage it through their inability to\ntreat all regions and all citizens as equal. <span> </span>The above are only the tip of the iceberg: This\ncabinet as well as its predecessors have failed to combat corruption that has\nbecome endemic, have neglected to construct a reliable electric grid in a self\ndescribed tourist state and have dared to introduce economic legislation and practices\nthat defy any and all teachings of any school of thought in the field. And\nfinally the cabinets for the past twenty years have acted as if the national\nsovereign debt challenge does not exist; they hope that the probability of a\npotential offshore gas find is going to resolve this issue. That is so\nirresponsible that it reminds me of the Greek tragedies whose plot builds up to\na level that is impossible to solve until a deus ex machina appears. (A\nheavenly solution</span><span><span>:-)</span></span><span>). </span>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\n<span>The Lebanese\npoliticians have had so many opportunities to prove their allegiance to the\ncountry, to democracy and to law and order.

Nevertheless, in my humble opinion, none of his previous work equals the flawlessness of his Fall Winter 2013 collection. It was simply incredible. I’m sure you’ve already seen the pictures I previously posted on L’Armoire De Lana’s social media accounts and you might also heard how good the feedback was in all the international press!<br>\nJust as always, it was a collection focused on very-well tailored pieces with everything looking just right from the pants to the coats to the structured dresses. I particularly loved the fur details and the leopard print that was done in just the right tone. There were also a lot of dresses and what I loved about them is how light and comfortable they looked, which is not something we usually see in a winter collection. My favorite part were the colors,namely the bleu gitane and the coral red which were just amaaaazing!!!!!!! It was also interesting how Rabih mixed a bleu gitane sweater with a flowy leopard print skirt. Last but not least, I’m definitely getting a pair of the collection’s shoes. Aren’t they so sexy? Plus, although they have an arched heel, the models seemed so comfortable walking in them.<br>\nYour thoughts on the collection?<br><a

Honestly speaking, both points of view make sense, so you decide!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Admin R:</strong> </em>An edgy new campaign by Clementine for YASA aimed at distracted drivers, is being rolled out across social media “betheb el seraa, ma tmout fiya”. The idea is to remind drivers to keep their eyes on the road and lessen the amount of accidents.<br>\nThese types of awareness campaigns were done once by Lebanese actors such as Georges Khabbaz, Carmen Lebbos and others for ‘Kunhadi’, but didn’t make sense back then.<br>\nThis time, May Sahab, a Lebanese actress & an anchor carried the flag; she stated a true story, her painful experience. May lost her husband, whom she waited around 14 years to get married to, the Father of a 1year old girl and a baby coming to this messed up world soon, (<em>I have seen her bump in the ad, Admin I didn’t, he thinks it’s a missing link, whatever, talk to the hand!</em>)<br>\nThere wasn’t acting (although i never miss noticing it, #Lebanese series #lousy acting).<br>\nNobody in this campaign is attempting to use “tears” to sell a product; there was real burning non shed-tears on the ultimate verge of a heartbreak.<br>\nThis approach is touching and authentic, making a buzz because it’s using a famous person’s sad story as a testimony, but does it minimize the rate of car crashes and loss?</p>\n<p><strong><em>HF:</em></strong><em> </em>You would expect to be touched by an awareness campaign in a way or another, but unfortunately, when I watched the new ad by YASA, I just sat there with a poker face and I got a bit confused. Regardless if you know May Sahhab’s story or not (I personally didn’t), You can’t but notice how broken hearted the woman is, but the problem is the confusing script, I mean, what the hell was she talking about? To someone that doesn’t already know the details, the ad looks like a weak staged performance with a lot of glitches in the copywriting/scriptwriting itself.<br>\nAfter tweeting the ad and expressing how useless it was for me, I got a DM from a fellow tweep, explaining to me about May’s tragedy that happened last year. To be very honest, I got emotional just by reading the message and knowing the details. I had to know more so I watched her interview on MTV’s Talk of the town, I got goosebumps during the whole thing.<br>\nThe TVC, although revolves on story telling (pff, the new trend) doesn’t explain much, and it could have been any woman out there who lost a husband, child or brother…The story is touching, especially the pregnancy part (that should’ve been highlighted smartly, but it’s Clementine in the end), I had to do my own research for a clearer insight.<br>\nOn another note, we’ve had enough of these kinds of ads, yes it might be touching but what’s next? Are these ads effective? What is awareness without a change in behavior?!</p>\n<p><strong>See? You guys should be the judge!</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/brofessionalreview.wordpress.com/2537/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/brofessionalreview.wordpress.com/2537/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=brofessionalreview.com&blog=28964988&post=2537&subd=brofessionalreview&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

She was raped because she does not wear the Hijab. She got verbally assaulted because she was “too sexy”. Clothing is a factor that attracts rapists.</em></p>\n<p>There are so many wrongs with these statements. I used to believe that such points of view were quite extinct, but turns out they are still widespread in this society.</p>\n<p>Yesterday was women’s day <em>(and that’s no cause to celebrate when one women dies each month from domestic violence, so let’s put the cake aside)</em>. Yesterday was the day when I became sure of my decision to be a Feminist. Yesterday, I heard horrific statements from classmates, colleagues, and friends. Yesterday, images of my mother and sister went through my head as I was hearing horrific expressions coming from pure patriarchy and inhumanity. Statements coming from people I share a class with, people living in the same building as mine, people whom I thought were the hope of the future.</p>\n<p>I have not quite lost faith in humanity yet, but I need to put out all the ‘ideas’ that have been boiling in my head ever-since these people started opening their mouths to utter them.</p>\n<p>So, rape and assault. There are still people out there who still believe that women are to blame  in incidents of rape. The goal of this post is to refute those beliefs in 9 points or less.</p>\n<p><strong>1- “It’s about what she was wearing.”</strong></p>\n<p>I was walking in Bliss Street last Thursday when I saw a lady wearing the Hijab getting eyeballed and receiving degrading hand gestures from a disgusting taxi driver stuck in traffic.</p>\n<p>Also,<a href="http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/elderly-nun-raped-and-killed-26065185.html"> an elderly nun was raped and killed in Ireland</a>. I’m very certain nun clothing is not very provocative, is it?</p>\n<p>A wide array of scientific research and personal stories deny statement number one.</p>\n<p><a href="http://mokhlibnene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tumblr_luvwphs7ld1r6zdqno1_500.jpg"><img alt="tumblr_luvwphS7LD1r6zdqno1_500" src="http://mokhlibnene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tumblr_luvwphs7ld1r6zdqno1_500.jpg?w=279&h=420" width="279" height="420"></a></p>\n<p><strong>2- “If it’s not clothing, what is it then? Do I hide my kids?”</strong></p>\n<p>The factor is vulnerability. If the victim comes across as a vulnerable person, he/she becomes a possible target of assault/rape. It’s a matter of predator and prey – vulnerability is everything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A ‘conservatively-dressed’ woman is walking on the street, would a predator call her names?</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>A woman wearing a mini-skirt walks down a street, would a predator call her names?</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>A woman wearing a mini-skirt walks down a street, but is holding a gun, would a predator call her names?</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>A woman wearing a mini-skirt walks down a street, but is walking with a muscular guy, would a predator call her names?</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s all in vulnerability.</p>\n<p><strong>3- “Girls in miniskirts get assaulted more than those in Hijab.”</strong></p>\n<p>I will reply to this with a simple photo:</p>\n<p><a href="http://mokhlibnene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/28ldkx.jpg"><img alt="28ldkx" src="http://mokhlibnene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/28ldkx.jpg?w=610"></a></p>\n<p>The third statement is not true. “<em>There is the obvious fact that in a society where most women are veiled, then widespread sexual harassment will fall most heavily on <strong>veiled women</strong> rather than the minority which refuses to adopt veiling. More than that, though, I suspect that when a woman veils then she is seen as signaling that she submits to the patriarchal assumptions about a woman’s “proper” place in society and subordinate position relative to men. Unveiled women, in contrast, are seen as signaling that they don’t submit — that they challenge patriarchal demands.” – </em>Austin Cline</p>\n<p>Let’s ask a veiled woman.<em> “Ladies that wear Hijab, they still attract men. I know because, even when I’m wearing Hijab, I get a lot of men that still try to get my attention, flirting and going on. So even if you wear Hijab, men will still want to get your attention, so for a two year old it’ll be the same,”</em> Olefa Ali said.</p>\n<p><em>“I have met a great many attractive women, and have seen virtually none of them naked, and very few in skimpy attire – yet I still would label them as attractive.”</em> says Pulitzer Laureate.</p>\n<p><a href="http://mokhlibnene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/34erlz8.jpg"><img alt="34erlz8" src="http://mokhlibnene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/34erlz8.jpg?w=488&h=390" width="488" height="390"></a></p>\n<p>I am not against woman wearing the Hijab. It is like me wearing red pants. Everyone has the right to dress in what suits their liking. But that will not plainly affect your chances of being assaulted.</p>\n<p><strong>4- “Attractive girls get assaulted more than ugly ones.”</strong></p>\n<p><em>Rapists don’t really care about how attractive someone is. Rape is not about attraction, it is about power and opportunity.</em><br><em>Next you’ll ask why fat or ugly children are worried about being molested by pedophiles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>5- “Do these men feel bad for assaulting a girl? How can they accept it?”</strong></p>\n<p>These men rationalize their behavior through the excuses we provide them with. I can kiss up to her boobs if she’s wearing a T-shirt, since by wearing a T-shirt she is doing something wrong and “asking for it”. As long as the men are able to rationalize their behavior as a just response to women who are doing something wrong, they are virtually certain to keep it up. If we, as a society, make their excuses invalid, they will stop using them. If we spread the fact that clothing does not matter, less men will be able to excuse themselves from feeling guilt.</p>\n<p>And feeling guilt is a good start.</p>\n<p><strong>6-</strong> <strong>“More people on the street = less chances of assault”</strong></p>\n<p>This is not about burglary (which is socially undesirable by everyone). This is about patriarchy.</p>\n<p><em>“As women, we follow our grandmother’s advice — not to come home late, walk in a crowded area because people can protect you and never walk down a dark or desolate street — and we know all this very well - </em><em>But what [our research showed] was something completely different from the stereotypes — sexual harassment occurring in crowded areas, even if the women were covered from head to toe.” – <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/region/egypt/open-assault-on-dignity-1.628475">Gulf News</a></em></p>\n<p>Assault takes place everywhere. From the the busy main street of Hamra at 8PM, to the not-very-crowded Kornish El Manara at 6AM.</p>\n<p><strong>7- “Women who appear to be from the opposite religious faith of the predator are more likely to be harassed.”</strong></p>\n<p>If that was true, I’d like to question what good this religion would be bringing upon that particular society, and what morals it would be really teaching – especially when it</p>\n<p><img alt="not-asking-for-it" src="http://mokhlibnene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/not-asking-for-it.jpg?w=202&h=304" width="202" height="304"></p>\n<p>comes to how it looks at women who do not ‘follow’ what that religious preaches.</p>\n<p><strong>8- “She deserves it.”</strong><br>\nNo one deserves it. I won’t even honor this with a reply.</p>\n<p><strong>9- “What can I do not to come across as vulnerable then?”</strong></p>\n<p>After making the point that clothing is not what really matters, some women might ask this question. The real answer is simply not appearing as a vulnerable person – not appearing as a subordinate of a horrific patriarchal system. Stand up for yourself when you can. When someone calls you<em> “Ya Ashta”</em>, do not just ignore and keep walking, reinforcing their behavior. Know how to fight back and be strong. For if you do not revolt, no one will ever do it for you.</p>\n<p>It won’t happen overnight, but we are fighting.</p>\n<p>And we will get there.</p>\n<p>Sources: <a href="http://atheism.about.com/b/2010/06/02/how-does-the-burqa-protect-women-sexual-assault-in-egypt.htm">1</a>, <a href="http://www.vocfm.co.za/index.php/news/contemporary-islam/item/8208-%E2%80%98baby-burqa-won%E2%80%99t-curb-rape%E2%80%99">2</a>, <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110824113550AA16E9g">3</a></p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://mokhlibnene.wordpress.com/category/society-2/">Society</a>  <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mokhlibnene.wordpress.com&blog=32724713&post=1308&subd=mokhlibnene&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

Optimists would argue the doctor simply tried not to put the patient’s life at risk.</span></div>\n<div><span>U.S. President Barack Obama faces a similar problem with the Syrian patient. The intentions of the other treating physician – Russian President Vladimir Putin – are flagrant. But there is no escape from leaving the Syrian patient under the consortium’s care.</span></div>\n<div><span>Obama and Putin know the medication they prescribed is not working. They asked their foreign ministers to get together and hammer out a political solution. </span></div>\n<div><span>The two presidents are aware the regime totally rejects “peace” as a self-defeating proposition and that the opposition craves for peace after having been forced to take up arms.</span></div>\n<div><span>The two presidents also realize the regime’s talk of “negotiations” is a PR gimmick.</span></div>\n<div><span>To pave the way for peace negotiations between the two warring sides, the regime and the Russian Federation want arming of the opposition to cease.</span></div>\n<div><span>But there are no “two warring sides.” There is simply a repressive regime bent on retaining power on one side and an enraged and revolting population seeking freedom and a new Syria on the other.</span></div>\n<div><span>The regime is not facing one Syrian party or sect.

It will be rejected again and again for evermore.</span></div>\n<div><span>Peace and nonviolence don’t work in the regime’s favor. The regime lives by the sword and won’t win except by the sword.</span></div>\n<div><span>So why waste time on fruitless initiatives? </span></div>\n<div><span>The answer lies in the game of so-called “international diplomacy.” </span></div>\n<div><span>Obama, Jordan’s King Abdullah, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and all Arab and European leaders wish for something to happen in Damascus that would bring the conflict to a close without their intervention.</span></div>\n<div><span>But there are no signs of such a thing happening. </span></div>\n<div><span>Instead, the Syria crisis has started spilling over.</span></div>\n<div><span>Seven Iraqis were killed last week as they escorted Syrian soldiers who had sought refuge in Iraq after being evicted from a border crossing.

However, you guys also know I sometimes go to, “unorthodox” lengths to try to get in somewhere or into something.</p>\n<p>I was in Uruguay Street the other weekend because I got tipped off that something cool was happening and there was gonna be a group filming it. I thought it was just another boring corporate event I get all those emails with only “Dear” in the title. But, when I got there, I saw Nissan cars with sirens on top and realized it’s cool, and that I didn’t just want the scoop on it, but be part of it. So, like the hoards of men taking photos of the hot police officers, I blended in and saw what was happening. They were rounding up <em>really </em>wasted folks and giving them hilarious sobriety tests and those that failed, were “arrested” and taken home in a Nissan and their own cars driven home by someone sober. One of the “suspects” was so wasted he vomited (not shown in the video for the squeamish I guess).</p>\n<p>One dude danced PSY’s Gangnam Style, I twirled around like a ballerina with my hands on my head spelling my full name backwards and we even got mug shots. Of course, I wasn’t drunk, and in hindsight, my lie sort of sucked since 5 beers and 3 cocktails is a lot for <em>anyone.</em> Regardless, I got to do the tests and Officer Tara caught on to me (my desire to shine in dance and spelling my name backwards outweighed my poor acting skills).</p>\n<p>So, as I was being shooed away, I asked, since I am not drunk, if I could drive the Juke and test it out, you know, maybe plug in my phone in the auxiliary… After making me wait while more folks were rounded up and tested, I got the OK and at around 3:00AM got to drive the Juke around and get the hangover kit they were distributing. Being completely sober, I later headed to PC and then Max Cooper that night, happy I got to test the car out just a week before another test drive I’ll be talking about soon!</p>\n<p>Best part is, that was the first time they were doing this, but not the last. All throughout March, you can get in contact with them and report your friends. I’m <em>definitely </em>going to do it to one of you drunkies in Hamra’s alleyway or Mar Mikhael. I think it’s a nice activation that actually serves some purpose.

I will be attending a press screening next week and posting a quick review. You can read more about it [<a href="http://hadjithomasjoreige.com/wide_posts/the-lebanese-rocket-society/">Here</a>].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\nThe adventure of the Lebanese Rocket Society began, in the early sixties, at Haigazian University, a young Armenian University in Beirut, where a group of students, led by a professor of mathematics, Manoug Manougian, set up the Lebanese Rocket Society to “create and launch rockets for space study and exploration.” They produced the first rocket of the Arab World. The project had no military character and was aimed at promoting science and research.</p>\n<p>The adventure, which appears nowadays rather unbelievable and surrealistic, was nevertheless a serious one. Between 1960 and 1967 – at the time of the Space Race, revolutionary ideas, and Pan-Arabism – more than ten solid fuel Cedar rockets were launched. The launchings gave rise to national celebrations. To commemorate the 21st anniversary of Lebanon’s independence, a set of stamps representing the Cedar IV rocket was issued. The Arab defeat of 1967 put an end to the initiative and slowed down the thrive towards this aspect of technological modernity of this part of the world.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, considering the world divisions and the bellicose attitudes, it would be unconceivable to allow a small team of dreamers to launch rockets into the skies of the Middle East.</p>\n<p>The project enables us to consider the historic events of those years: pan-Arabism, the notion of a vast Arab nation and its decline after the Arab armies were defeated by Israel in 1967. A defeat which confused our societies, our parents’ generation, and which transformed deeply the Arab world and, first and foremost, our image of ourselves.</p>\n<p>The documents, photos and mainly films relating to the space project have disappeared.</p>\n<p>This unusual and heroic adventure, which had made the front pages of the press, is nowadays forgotten. It appears like an anecdote in the course of history, a story kept secret.</p>\n<p>The project investigates the apparent absence of the Lebanese space program from our personal and collective memory, shedding light on our perceptions of the past and present – and our imagination of the future, exploring the notion of a collective dream. Documents and archives as well as reconstitutions and art installations attempt to question this story and the ideas of reenactment, reconstitution and restaged in the present time.

These pages do shine some light on our dark reality with a smile, but  always running away from reality and not facing it will not solve anything. There are those in Lebanon who are sacrificing their lives for change, who are taking those battles upon themselves. They may not be playing their cards right, they may not be as efficient and productive, but they are doing something about it, instead of simply watching and criticizing.</p>\n<p>In a country that brags about women rights, liberties and open-mindedness, article <a href="http://www.delete522.com/about-campaign-522-rape-lebanon/">522 </a>of the  Lebanese penal code states, and I apologize for lack of legal translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a legal marriage is established between the criminal accused of any of the acts listed above (mainly acts of sexual coercion, rape and kidnapping) and his victim, then the legal case against the criminal is dropped…</p>\n<p dir="rtl" align="right">المادة522- معدلة وفقا للقانون تاريخ 5/2/1948</p>\n<p dir="rtl" align="right">إذا عقد زواج صحيح بين مرتكب إحدى الجرائم الواردة في هذا الفصل وبين المعتدى عليها أوقفت الملاحقة وإذا كان صدر الحكم بالقضية علق تنفيذ العقاب الذي فرض عليه.</p>\n<p dir="rtl" align="right">يعاد إلى الملاحقة أو تنفيذ العقوبة قبل انقضاء ثلاث سنوات على الجنحة وانقضاء خمس سنوات على الجناية إذا انتهى الزواج إما بطلاق المرأة دون سبب مشروع أو بالطلاق المحكوم به لمصلحة المعتدى عليها.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Ironically, the law is not only penal, but anal at the same time.</p>\n<p>March 8,2013 was the International day for Women.

Martin Grant presented at Paris Fashion Week probably one of my favorite Fall Winter 2013 collections. When I posted the pictures on the blog’s Instagram, Facebook & Twitter accounts, I was very happy to see most of you were just as excited about his work as I was.</span><br><span> In terms of colors, the collection was mostly dominated by grey, navy, black and nude. As for the shoes, they were all Christian Louboutin kitten heels and the touch of the red sole was the perfect finishing touch to all of the outfits. It added so much more femininity and a hint of color.</span><br><span> As for the clothes, I really liked the full suits, the ruffles on the dresses and coats and the final amazing corset and dress. There was something about this collection that felt good and easy to wear. I could honestly add half of it to my closet. The modern working woman can rock any of the pants and coats looks by day and the very elegant short dresses by night. My top outfits were the all-black look with that coat with gorgeous ruffles, the entirely nude look composed of a very-well tailored pants and coat, all of the short black dresses and the final corset-tulle gown.<br><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1740.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="IMG_1740" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1740-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG 1740 1024x768 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="438"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0614.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0614" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0614-1024x680.jpg" alt="DSC 0614 1024x680 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="387"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0624.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0624" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0624-1024x680.jpg" alt="DSC 0624 1024x680 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="387"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0625.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0625" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0625-1024x680.jpg" alt="DSC 0625 1024x680 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="387"></a></span><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0630.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0630" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0630-e1362766306401-680x1024.jpg" alt="DSC 0630 e1362766306401 680x1024 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="879"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0634.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0634" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0634-e1362766418852-680x1024.jpg" alt="DSC 0634 e1362766418852 680x1024 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="879"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0639.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0639" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0639-e1362766570413-680x1024.jpg" alt="DSC 0639 e1362766570413 680x1024 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="879"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0652.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0652" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0652-e1362766744557-680x1024.jpg" alt="DSC 0652 e1362766744557 680x1024 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="879"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0658.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0658" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0658-e1362766844178-680x1024.jpg" alt="DSC 0658 e1362766844178 680x1024 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="879"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0660.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0660" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0660-e1362766998148-680x1024.jpg" alt="DSC 0660 e1362766998148 680x1024 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="879"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0646.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="DSC_0646" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0646-e1362767108821-680x1024.jpg" alt="DSC 0646 e1362767108821 680x1024 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="879"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1820.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="IMG_1820" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1820.jpg" alt="IMG 1820 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="600" height="800"></a><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1838.jpg" rel="lightbox[10209]"><img title="IMG_1838" src="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1838-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG 1838 1024x768 Around the World: Martin Grant FW13   #PFW" width="584" height="438"></a> <span> I want to hear your opinion about this designer and collection!</span><br><span> Please note Martin Grant is exclusively available at Piaff Boutique in Lebanon.

Once his work in Lebanon was up and he had to go back to China, he presented at the MEA counter at the airport but the employee refused to issue him a ticket.</p>\n<p>She said he didn’t have a visa for Dubai, which he did. He was also going through Dubai simply as transit to China, which is allowed even if you don’t have a visa. So shouting at the Chinese man, the employee talked down to him, dismissing him. A quarrel ensued, which was only stopped up by another employee interfering and issuing the ticket in question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wonder: how difficult is it for MEA to vet its employees before actually hiring them when it comes to the most basic of qualities that people who handle international customers should have? Or how difficult is it to actually have MEA’s employees go through some trainings in dealing with customers in respectable ways to bring them to the 21st century where a passenger isn’t dismissed based on the color of his skin or how stretched his eyes are?</p>\n<p>Racism isn’t exclusive to MEA. It spreads to a lot of people across Lebanon with <a title="Racist Lebanese Municipalities & Marwan Charbel’s Inadequacy" href="http://stateofmind13.com/2013/02/25/racist-lebanese-municipalities-marwan-charbels-inadequacy/">municipalities illegally banning Syrians (and officials who don’t want to do anything about it)</a> to severe discrimination against migrant workers even in the media that should be helping to lessen this among people (<a title="The Lebanese Help: New TV Hosts Ali Mahfouz – The Man Who Beat Up The Ethiopian Maid" href="http://stateofmind13.com/2012/03/18/the-lebanese-help-new-tv-hosts-ali-mahfouz-the-man-who-beat-up-the-ethiopian-maid/">link</a>). But the least we should expect is for one of the country’s major companies – especially one that represents Lebanon to the entire world – to be stringent with the image it wants to give to the world.</p>\n<p>As for how I believe racism in Lebanon should stop, I quote something I wrote (<a href="http://stateofmind13.com/2012/10/10/mea-fires-racist-employee/">link</a>) when the first racism incidence with MEA happened:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Racism isn’t also a Lebanese problem. It is a worldwide problem that takes many forms. It transcends the hate towards others based on skin color. It is the intolerance towards another’s religion, the intolerance towards another’s nationality. And if a country doesn’t have a predominant problems with someone’s race, then they probably have a problem with differing religions. It is the problem of “difference.”</p>\n<p>We dislike those with whom we can’t easily relate.</p>\n<p>So what’s different between Lebanon and those supposedly racism-free countries? It’s quite simple: accountability. And that’s what works most with us Lebanese: a slap on the wrist when we do stuff wrong (fines for smoking, for not putting on the seatbelt, for speeding….)</p>\n<p>People who get accused of racism in those countries have consequences to deal with. In our country, racism is met with indifference. A prominent TV anchor was blantly saying that an Ethiopian maid who committed suicide a few months ago was deranged (click <a title="The Lebanese Help: New TV Hosts Ali Mahfouz – The Man Who Beat Up The Ethiopian Maid" href="http://stateofmind13.com/2012/03/18/the-lebanese-help-new-tv-hosts-ali-mahfouz-the-man-who-beat-up-the-ethiopian-maid/">here</a>)- and he found no trouble at all in passing his ideology to his viewers. I’m sure he got high ratings for that episode as well.</p>\n<p>If that anchor had met the same fate as the employee, people would have known that what he said was wrong. They would have known that talking badly against someone else just because you don’t like the skin they were born in is unacceptable. And they would have realized that it is no longer accepted to have it happen.</p>\n<p>Their racism would then regress – it would get suppressed. And that is how other countries do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/category/lebanon/">Lebanon</a> Tagged: <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/airport/">Airport</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/china/">China</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/lebanon/">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/mea/">MEA</a>, <a href="http://stateofmind13.com/tag/racism/">Racism</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/stateofmind13.wordpress.com/7435/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=stateofmind13.com&blog=19416533&post=7435&subd=stateofmind13&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

As a qualified nurse, she was known in her poverty stricken suburb for her kindness and generosity.

The same point for the existence of Santa Claus, its funny in a way to get the child understand the meaning of birth and get him engaged in the meaning of sacrificing, loving others, and exchanging gifts.

It’s either activism or not, so feminism doesn’t exist for me. </em></p>\n<p>This previous fact check was just to say that covering the uprising of women in the<strong> Arab world انتفاضة المرأة في العالم العربي</strong> comes from a background of mere creative communication, and a question of online vrs. reality. It all starts by the what-so-called ‘Arab Spring’ and particularly the Egyptian Tahreer square on-going revolution; what is highly problematic about what happened in Egypt, as our friend “Daniel Drennan” points it out, is that it was mediated as a ‘twitter revolution’, disregarding all classes of people, the poor, the illiterate, and mainly, the courageous women of Egypt that went and spent days and nights protesting:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span>The women’s role in the Egyptian revolution was more strikers in the textile mills of the north, who organized themselves and struck for higher wages, and who for years laid the groundwork for the eventual (over-mediated) demonstrations in Cairo and elsewhere. This was all organized by women, but went unacknowledged by the mediated realm because, well, these are muhajabi’in, and they don’t “visually” fit the universalist feminist model. Another group of women who sustained the revolution were those who cooked and brought sustenance to those protesting in Tahrir Square. The People’s history will triumph!</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>This ridiculously labeled ‘twitter’ revolution, kept on going on several tangents; few months ago, this social media platform got flood by pictures of this ‘women spring’ intifada, each from her room, with a piece of paper and a handwritten statement: the one outsmarting the other, with a line, a visual and a tweet. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to be a party pooper here (in this case, revolution pooper!) but all what I’m saying is that words in our today’s world are getting smacked and beaten to an extent of sticking a something like ‘intifada’ to any sort of potential hypothesis, though what is really outstanding about this whole thing, is how an online movement made it to an audience (it’s the wrong audience), through a simple social media effort, with no ‘clear’ advertising impact, and no multinationals using the cause for award shows.</p>\n<p>My dear mothers and sisters, we’ll be super supportive when it comes to your rights, we’ll back you up as a free interactive platform, but let us discuss some issues: do you really think twitter pictures with duck faces could claim nationalities for your children? Do you really think that alienating yourselves from other social activism topics can help you stop the suffering? Do you really believe that a facebook page and a twitter account can truly reflect a ‘real’ women’s struggle, you know the kind that doesn’t sit behind a desk and a retina display mac?</p>\n<p>Happy international women’s day, whatever it is.</p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/brofessionalreview.wordpress.com/2521/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/brofessionalreview.wordpress.com/2521/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=brofessionalreview.com&blog=28964988&post=2521&subd=brofessionalreview&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">\n'),

It was amazing! I want to thank Bouchra (Aishti), Sandra and Josette (LVMH Dubai) for the great opportunity.</span><br><span>The chosen venue was the Palais National des Invalides. As soon as I entered the space, I was in awe. The setting was filled with enormous silver balloons and mirrors for a metallic effect all over. It was so much fun walking through the venue that I actually lost my way twice while walking to my seat because of all the reflections. Such a playful idea as later during the show, as the models walked down we could see them in the silver balloons beforehand.

There was a lot of nude pink, houndstooth patterns and voluminous skirts and corsets. The elegance and femininity of the modern women were celebrated. Architecture was clearly one of Simon’s inspiration for Fall Winter 2013 as most details exuded about strong graphism. </span><br><span>I fell in love with the “talon virgule” or curved-heeled shoes. I think they just looked gorgeous with every single outfit. They will also be produced using fishnet fabrics, snakeskin and many other. As for the bags, I particularly LOVED the Lady Dior which with an Andy Warhol shoe sketch printed on them (this is the result of a collaboration with the Andy Warhol foundation). This sketch was also seen on dresses.

The 21st century\nsaw mass proliferation of affordable cellular telephony, altering not simply\nthe way people kept in touch, but did business and waged war. For the U.S.\nmilitary, cell phones posed a potentially dangerous problem. In addition to\nenabling a new generation of remotely-controlled IEDs, they helped insurgents\ncoordinate larger and more complex groups, extending mobile C3 to any group\nwith a tower in range and minutes bought.<br><br>\nYet, as <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~jns/papers/SW_2011_Cell_Phones_Insurgency_21DEC11.pdf">Jacob\nShapiro and Nils Weidman argue in a fascinating study</a>, booming cellphone\nuse cut against insurgencies. Rather than enabling more IED attacks, they made\nit easier for civilians to inform on insurgents. Cellphones could even fill\ngaps in counterinsurgent communication networks while exposing insurgent communications\nto U.S. superiority in electronic warfare. Looking at a systemic level rather\nthan narrowly at one actor’s applications of a technology, mobile telephony’s\nexpansion more likely helped than hindered counterinsurgents.<br><br>\nThe dynamic\nbetween new technology, conflict, and social systems frequently lends itself to\noversimplification. Cell phones neither made nor broke U.S. operations in Iraq,\nand although the Taliban appears to recognize their threat, they do not\ndetermine the course of the war there either. Despite the rapidly proliferating\nquantity and falling price of many new technologies, technical military\ndominance remains and incredibly expensive affair. <br><br>\nWhile it is\nnot incredibly difficult to probe the DoD’s cybersecurity or even penetrate its\nnetworks, launching computer network attacks sophisticated enough to\nsignificantly degrade the <a href="http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2012/06/curious-invisibility-military-cyberpower.html">U.S.’s overwhelming strength</a> requires not just a\nbuilt-up IT infrastructure for computer network attack, but a wide spectrum of\nelectronic warfare capabilities and enough conventional punch to exploit the\ngap. Even in these scenarios, states such as China, Russia, the U.S. and Israel\ncontinue to enjoy massive advantages over non-state groups and poor or weak\nstates when it comes to information warfare. The costs in human and\ntechnological capital significantly mitigates the disruptive effects of the\ntechnology.<br><br>\nSimilarly,\nwith remotely-operated and robotic weapons, rudimentary capabilities vastly\nproliferated but constraints remain on their ability to substitute for or\nsupplement inadequate conventional capability. Basic, cost-intensive issues of\nphysics and logistics, such as size, payload, and the availability of\nmilitary-grade air-launched munitions limit the lethality of “personal” aerial drones, while even\nstate actors without adequate C4ISR infrastructure or the conventional means to\nenable drone operations will find it difficult to radically change their means.<br><br>\nIt should be\nunsurprising that until the mid-20th century, a major narrative in Western\nthought was not technology getting the barbarians closer to crashing the gate,\nbut fueling the rise of an ever vaster and more terrible Leviathan. Increasing\ntechnical complexity and costs to waging war indeed promoted the ascent of the\nmodern state. As the trend continued, bureaucracies and state power grew even\nin the most liberal states, while the Soviet Union and fascist Europe pointed\ntowards state power, economic advancement, and military-technical strength\ngoing hand in hand. Even before totalitarianism, fin de siècle Britons such as\n<a href="http://arno.daastol.com/books/SEMMEL,%20IMPERIALISM%20AND%20SOCIAL%20REFORM%20(1960).pdf">Halford Mackinder, Leo Amery, and H.G. Wells</a> saw new technology militating\ntowards stronger and larger states. This was a trend the experience of the\nWorld Wars and Cold War only seemed to reinforce, until the fall of the USSR\nand heightened concern with disruptive technologies, anarchic failed states,\nand the power of individuals.<br><br>\nDespite the\nobvious oversights of those who took the writings of Orwell and Burnham a bit\ntoo far to heart, it’s important to remember that many of the technologies\nthought to be rolling back state power came about through state action and\noperate most powerfully with the state’s resources behind them. The glut of\nsmall arms and light weapons in conflict zones are frequently legacy of <a href="http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/B-Occasional-papers/SAS-OP16-West-Europe.pdf">state-backed\nmass production</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/middleeast/29military.html">proxy\nwar supplies</a>, or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/world/africa/looted-libyan-arms-in-mali-may-have-shifted-conflicts-path.html">states\ntoppled with the aid of conventional power</a>.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Engineers-Politics-Technology-Security/dp/0801474876">Keil\nLieber ably demonstrated the errors of confounding technical systems with undue\npolitical attributes</a> in his dissection of offense-defense balance in IR\ntheory. For issues of state-building and insurgency, a similar look at how\ndisruptive technologies require enabling and support from a wider variety of\nsocial and political factors makes it much easier to explain why some\ntechnology erodes the power of one state while vastly bolstering another. At a\nbroader, systemic level, though, asking whether this or that technology\nbolsters or erodes state authority is likely asking the wrong question.<br><br>\nTo note the\nincreasing sophistication of non-state groups is not to imply the erosion of\nthe state or even an adverserial relationship between state authority and other\nforms. Instead, given that assemblages of state power remain the dominant\nterritorial and political forms (<a href="http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/Articles/09summer/phillips.pdf">even\nif they deviate from our expectations</a>), investigating the parasitic,\ncommensalist, and symbiotic relationships between them will likely be the best\nway both to assess the political impacts of proliferating technology and the\nemergent shape of world order.</p>'),

About twelve years ago the\nofficer who consolidated power in his own hands , surrounded himself with co\nreligionists and ruled as a dictator who can never be crossed died. He was very\nclever though, and so he made sure that a son of his, an eye doctor, would take\nover from him when he dies.</div>\n<div>\nThe dictator who would not allow any opposition or\ndissenters died but made sure that his successor will be his totally inexperienced\neye doctor son. The Ophthalmologist continued the rule of fear started by his\nfather but yet made many promises along the way that he would encourage social\nequality. Unfortunately he did not put into practice any of the informed\nreforms that he had promised. Actually, as opportunities presented themselves\nthe son God became ever more convinced that his subjects are not smart enough\nto rule themselves. He even preached that his one party rule is efficient and\nthat his entourage is not capable of making any wrong calls. The party was\ninfallible and all who would oppose it are traitors and imperialist pigs.</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\nLife under the son-God became more difficult than what it\nwas under his father and he thought that the people in his state are enamoured\nof him. One day though, a number of kids were playing an innocent ball game\nwhen they decided that it was about time that they show the authoritarian\nauthorities that they have had enough and that they will not take it any longer.\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\nSuch acts of defiance were deemed to be extremely dangerous\nby the absolute son God king. He ordered his subordinates to make a lesson of everyone\nwho dared question his authority. All the kids were to be arrested, beaten and\nthen set free.</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\nBut the unforeseen took place. Thousands upon thousands from\nacross the country joined the young and decided that the popular saying “Live free\nor die” was an idea whose time has come. They organized demonstrations and\nadopted acts of civil defiance in the hope that such peaceful moves will\ndemonstrate that illegitimacy must go.</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\nBut as bad luck would have it, the son God decided that he\nwill teach all those that dared demand what was theirs in the first place,a lesson.\nHe ordered his henchman to go out and spread fear among these youthful souls\nthrough beatings, arrests, mistreatments and the random acts of violence. When\nthese tactics did not prove to be sufficient to dampen the spirits of the\nfreedom fighters the son-God ordered his tanks, fighter jets, attack\nhelicopters and cluster bombs to be used indiscriminately. They were. The\nresult has been close to 100,000 deaths, a million wounded and the leveling of\none city quarter after another over its civilian inhabitants. None of this\nwould frighten the courageous youth anymore. They had vowed that they will not\nstop short of victory.</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n</div>\n<div>\n<span></span><span></span>The son-God did not like any of this. Minions had dared\nquestion his authority He ordered his personal guard to go out in the village\nand to wire all the building in the village with explosives. When after almost\n4 years of this mayhem it became clear that he could no longer deny the\ninevitability of his demise he ordered that every single building in the\nvillage is to be blown up over all its inhabitants. He had to go out in a blaze\nof glory. What a meaningless loss and what a fool he was. </div>\n'),

These <em>illegal</em> and blatantly racist banners and posters have been springing up in several areas where a rise in petty crime has been blamed on the influx of Syrian refugees.</p>\n<p>This is unacceptable, and despite the Minister of Interior Affairs and Municipalities indicating municipalities <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2013/Feb-25/207793-baabda-town-enacts-illegal-curfew-on-foreigners.ashx#axzz2MtoTxWJQ">had no right to enforce</a> such a curfew and that it was not within their jurisdictions to enforce one, the authorities have done nothing to remove these posters and discipline those behind them. One Baabda municipality chief even boasted “if we catch one, we’ll lock them up at the police station and send him off the next day”</p>\n<p>For those of you who do not read Arabic and wondering what the hell I’m talking about, the above announcement roughly translates as “WARNING. Due to the current security situation, any foreign individual may not go about past 8:00PM”</p>\n<p>Having disgruntled bigots and political leaders say these things might be understandble. They’re bigots and politicians and we expect no better from them. However, the municipality speaks on the behalf of its constituents in a more direct fashion, and I am certain that the average Lebanese citizen is not as cruel, inhumane and racist as these posters suggest. For shame.</p>\n<p>The Zouk Mikayel municipality hasn’t gone as far in their banners, and instead, posted a banner that translates “For our Syrian brethren residing in Zouk Mikayel, please proceed to the municipality to register your name and place of residence” which is slightly more acceptable, but highly unlikely since many of the refugees are afraid to disclose their locations for fear it could land in the hands of the regime or extremist rebel elements that might want to harm them, and I for one, would not trust Lebanese authorities with my safety and privacy.</p>\n<p>Here’s another example, courtesy of <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2013/Feb-25/207793-baabda-town-enacts-illegal-curfew-on-foreigners.ashx#axzz2MtoTxWJQ">The Daily Star</a> and <a href="http://ginosblog.com/Beirut.com">Beirut.com</a></p>\n\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/08/sedd-el-bauchrieh-hops-on-to-the-racism-bandwagon/490x368-3/" title="490x368"><img width="150" height="106" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/490x368.jpeg?w=150&h=106" alt="490x368"></a>\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/08/sedd-el-bauchrieh-hops-on-to-the-racism-bandwagon/149464_mainimg-1/" title="149464_mainimg-1"><img width="150" height="99" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/149464_mainimg-1.jpg?w=150&h=99" alt="149464_mainimg-1"></a>\n<a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/08/sedd-el-bauchrieh-hops-on-to-the-racism-bandwagon/bexuco5cmaezt2w/" title="BExuCO5CMAEZT2w"><img width="112" height="150" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bexuco5cmaezt2w.jpeg?w=112&h=150" alt="BExuCO5CMAEZT2w"></a>\n\n<p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12416/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12416/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12416&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1"></p>\n'),

It’s a very simple law really. It enables women to call the police for help if they are abused at home. And it enables them to seek shelter and protection with their kids. It basically says that women can leave their homes with the support of the state.</p>\n<p>It also overrides the current law, Article 503 that makes it legal for husbands to rape their wives.</p>\n<p>At least one woman is killed every month by a family member. That’s last year’s count. This year alone, there’s been 4 murders. Out of the 2250 women who reported family violence to the police in 2009, almost half said they feel a direct threat to their lives.</p>\n<p>The fact is, this law can save lives. An intervention can save a life. A phone call can save a life. Violence unstopped escalates into murder. At the heart of any feminist struggle is violence against women and this law is a crucial step towards ending violence against women. We’re not expecting it to do miracles, of course. But our battle isn’t just about this law. It’s with the patriarchy of our Parliament and Government who have proved again and again that they do not give a damn about women in Lebanon.</p>\n<p>We’ve tried protests and sit-ins and vigils and social media campaigns and meetings with MPs and billboards and awareness-raising and flyers and workshops and panels. We even tried interactive theater and flash mobs and dances. And still they tell us to wait.</p>\n<p>On February 24, Kafa organized a demo that marched to Nabih Berri’s house demanding that he put the law on the agenda of the parliamentary discussions. He replied on February 25 with: “It is not possible in these circumstances to hold a session while the country is drowning in the elections law.”</p>\n<p>And so, we have decided – some friends and I – that we are no longer putting up with this bullshit. Tonight we announce to the MPs that if the law to protect women from family violence is not put on the agenda for the next parliamentary session and if it is not voted on fully without mutilations, <strong>we are going on an open hunger strike in front of parliament</strong>. If they don’t mind women dying, we’ll give them starving women at their doorstep.</p>\n<p>This is our final battle and we are going to win it. Brace yourselves.</p>\n'),

The referee was provoking the team (Al Nahda) with his whistle, and that is what I told the 4th referee Jamil Ramadan. It’s as if there is a plan to  prevent Al Nahda from qualifying for the premier league in Lebanon, for certain reasons and motives”</p>\n<p>The sectarian influence is evident in this statement, with Seifeddine referring to the stadium on the Airport Road as “non-neutral” in reference to the predominantly Shiite population while the Al Nahda club’s traditionally considered a predominantly Sunni club. His allegations that there seems to be an ulterior motive to prevent the club from qualifying is also a poorly-veiled reference to sectarian divides.</p>\n<p>The sectarian considerations, coupled with the disgusting <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Sports/Football/2013/Feb-27/208084-scandal-shames-lebanese-football.ashx#axzz2MtoTxWJQ">match-fixing scandals</a> plaguing Lebanese football will undoubtedly push the underpaid and disgruntled players to do the unforgivable: attack a referee. It’s sad to see that politics and religion corrupt <em>everything</em> in Lebanon (and the world for that matter, where we see fundamentalist Islamist groups hijacking the Arab Spring and refusing to adhere to the secular principles the revolts were based upon).</p>\n<p>Personally, I am not very surprised. Corruption + no financing + religious fervor always = shit. I am a bit disappointed by Al Salam Zgharta, my town’s football team, for not living up to their name and protecting the referee from being given the beat-down of his life from the Al Nahda club.</p>\n<p>The player who attacked the referee has been <a href="http://www.sports-leb.com/sports/MoreNews.aspx?newsid=274194">suspended for a year</a>. I think the punishment should be much, much heavier, maybe some prison time too.</p>\n<p>It’s sad to see the one thing that made Lebanon proud for a brief time, has now followed suit like everything else in this country: succumbed to religious fundamentalism and corruption.</p>\n<p><em>Sources: <a href="http://figo29.com/2013/03/05/lebanese-football-rage-against-the-referee-and-civilization/">Figo29</a> and The Daily Star</em></p>\n<p>\n<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12406/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ginoraidy.wordpress.com/12406/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ginosblog.com&blog=11198665&post=12406&subd=ginoraidy&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1"></p>\n'),

It’s either his/her brains would be spinning or he/she would really be enjoying the “sexy” cop sitting next to them (not being a dirty mind perve, but isn’t that the point behind the big fake lips and good looking guys in a cop’s suit arresting you?)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>4- Please consider bringing a decent type of fake cops that could actually talk about a car and present the campaign’s message.</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>5- How are you telling me not to drink and drive..and you’re explaining to me how safe the car is..and that you want to drive me home safely? So that means that the car is safe and that I shouldn’t worry about me being drunk while driving because it’s Nissan..Or maybe Nissan comes with a hangover kit..or there’s a Nissan ride that is always there for me when I’m drunk to drive me..

I’m a sucker for colloquial artistry of any stripe, and his lyrics are sharp, funny, self-deprecating, and very revealing of Egyptian political and cultural dynamics — without sounding like flat commentary.

To reduce your re-Lebanization risk, then, please consider vacationing in Siberia, Antarctica, or the Falklands. (Areas with significant Lebanese diaspora populations may trigger symptoms too. Avoid the Americas, Europe, West Africa, the Arab Gulf, and Lacoste stores around the world.)</p>\n<p>Airports in Europe will test your ability to cope; apparently, the convergence of transatlantic travelers and their European diaspora counterparts increases contagion risks. A government official who isn’t important enough to name told NOW that “airport lounges are incubators for the disease… After prolonged exposure to damn Lebanese people in a confined area, even the most civil people succumb!”</p>\n<p>As you approach the departure gate, the diverse human terrain of America and Europe will recede. Sepia tones — the olive, bronze, brown, and “comme le caramel” of Lebanese folk — will surface instead. With a knowing glance, a wink, and a smirk, you’ll quickly identify your compatriots. At your leisure, you may now deploy the slightly contrived, but always welcome, “Keef el shabeb?!?”</p>\n<p>Boarding accelerates the emergence of symptoms. All of you will become less patient and courteous, inordinately sensitive to the transformation of others, and increasingly oblivious to your own behavior.

Someone has been defacing graffiti in Beirut - and by defacing I mean exactly that - taking faces off graffiti... At first I thought it was a crew war but sadly, the more I delved into this the more I realized that all graffiti works which have faces on them have been vandalized. I am not pointing fingers, but it is well known that according to some strict interpretations of Islam, no one is allowed to draw a face (or even take a photo of one) because on judgement day God will ask that person to breathe life into his/her "creation" just like God himself breathed life in Adam. Which makes the situation even more alarming if you ask me!</div>'),

The only reason I posted was because you’re a fun page and the video I saw was a bit too serious. </p>\n<p>Speaking of the SMAs, and as I stated in one of the comments, I had considered you but didn’t know where to nominate you. I even thought of asking the people behind SMA to add a category for fun and creative social media pages.</p>\n<p>What you said clarified things and I thank you for your honest and professional reply. As far as portraying the bad habits we have in Lebanon, I can’t help but comment on such things from time to time as well and try to make some fun out of it (through memes also) and Patrick did make a valid point.</p>\n<p><strong>PS: I would choose you over Nemr Abou Nassar anytime.</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks you la 2elak too :P </p>\n<blockquote><p>GoOd MoRninG LebAnOn – thx u Nath Halawani 4 sharing</p>\n<p>Don’t you love reading constructive criticism in early morning?</p>\n<p>Dear Blog Baladi thx u la elak for what you wrote :) I am only answering you because it is a respectful constructive mature criticism.</p>\n<p>- You wrote: “I was even more surprised to learn they are turning the Lebanese Memes Facebook page into some business with a mission”</p>\n<p>Lebanese memes is not a business, it is a “just for fun facebook page” which is trying to add value to the society. We are not turning it into anything, this was our mission statement since day 1.</p>\n<p>- You also wrote: “No Lebanese would want to spread the ways of life portrayed to foreigners because that’s not something to be proud of.”</p>\n<p>Patrick already answered you, Any comedian is technically “spreading the ways of life portrayed” in whatever country they’re living in, good or bad. Would you like to tell this to Nemr Abou Nassar for example? Not to mention that this page is for the fans (a 100% real community – NO FAKE LIKES) and they make most of the memes so we as a Lebanese Memes community, being away from politics and religion are trying to be sarcastic about what is happening in Lebanon and hoping to change things via humor.</p>\n<p>-You also wrote: “One last thing, I think they should remove the lame memes, not just the ones who are racist or sexist.”</p>\n<p>I would love to remove the memes that i find lame, but i have to respect the people who find it funny :) + the fans spend time in creating a meme and then sharing it on the page. It is their way of spreading their ideas lame or not.</p>\n<p>Thx u la elak again for what you wrote and hope that this reply will generate a good flow for your blog :)</p>\n<p>http://blogbaladi.com/lebanese-memes/</p></blockquote>'),

And while much will happen regardless of people’s good will and hopes for peace, the least we could do is learn from them and stop the blood and tears from going in vain. But even this exercise may have become too complicated for Lebanese to handle.</p>\n<p><a href="http://thecubelb.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/war-diary-lebanon-2006.jpg"><img alt="War Diary- Lebanon 2006" src="http://thecubelb.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/war-diary-lebanon-2006.jpg?w=230&h=344" width="230" height="344"></a></p>\n<p>In <i>War Diary: Lebanon 2006</i>, AUB professor and author of the <a href="http://landandpeople.blogspot.com/">Land and People</a> blog Rami Zurayk provides a day-to-day account of the 2006 July War and Israel’s indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon and its civilians. Zurayk’s personal account is filled with the same hopelessness and despair shared by many at the time, struggling through yet another conflict and hoping to make it through. His slightly dark humor and unrelenting sarcasm are mechanisms that many have used and continue to us through trying times to maintain some degree of sanity. But by no means does he remain indifferent to the underlying politics of the war. Zurayk is a leftist, Arabist, anti-colonialist and anti-Zionist at heart, whose atheism does not prevent him from supporting Hizballah during the war, in so far as his support is based on the latter’s “opposition to Israel and its commitment to armed struggle.”</p>\n<p>Reading it almost seven years since the war, the book reminds us how brutal of a southern neighbor we have, with its utter contempt towards civilians, the 2006 Qana Massacre being one of many such examples, proud to bomb a nation back to the “stone ages”, and acting with an unimaginable degree of impunity with little to answer to the rest of the world. But equally as important, it reminds us how Lebanon became so polarized during the war, as parts of the country seemed completely detached from the chaos and destruction only kilometers away. Under the bombs and daily threats, Zurayk ponders on essential questions about Lebanon, its people and what, if anything, keeps Lebanon together. One does not have to agree with Zurayk’s politics or the sides he takes during the war to agree that we have developed little as a single and united nation. And this will remain so long as we learn not to settle scores in times when faced with foreign threats (instead of dealing with our problems once the dust of gun powder settles), accept that Lebanon isn’t made only of those who share our own ideas (whether political, social or religious) and the need for all sides to accept this diversity if we care to live together.</p>\n<p>34 days after the first shots were fired, and “as if someone had suddenly switched the war off”, hostilities came to an end. For Zurayk, the war was a victory for Lebanon, though victory must be hard to quantify in the face of so much death and destruction. Perhaps a better means to quantify victory could be what good the Lebanese as people managed to take out of the conflict, which doesn’t seem to be much. Growing political and sectarian tensions since the conflict need only attest to this fact. Yet Zurayk believes that the war was won, but “we know there is no hope to change the world in our life time”. One cannot but agree that changing the world now seems farther than ever, but that’s a lesson I have chosen to contradict, no matter how small the change may be, starting with Lebanon…</p>'),

A touch of fire red added more strength to the collection and I was positively surprised about the use of linoleum green.

Many have repudiated their confessions at trial only to see the courts admit them as evidence of their guilt, without investigating their torture allegations, sentencing them to long term imprisonment or death.</span></div><div><span>Adding to the injustice, the authorities have paraded detainees before press conferences or arranged for their “confessions” to be broadcast on local television in advance of their trials or trial verdicts in gross breach of the presumption of innocence and of the right of every accused to receive a fair trial.</span></div><div><span>The death penalty was suspended after the 2003 invasion but quickly restored by the first Iraqi government on coming to power, and executions resumed in 2005.</span></div><div><span>Since then, at least 447 prisoners have been executed, including Saddam Hussein, some of his main associates, and alleged members of armed groups.</span></div><div><span>Hundreds of prisoners await execution on death row. Iraq, where 129 prisoners were hanged in 2012, is now one of the world’s leading executioners.</span></div><div><span>“Death sentences and executions are being used on a horrendous scale,” said Hadj Sahraoui, “It is particularly abhorrent that many prisoners have been sentenced to death after unfair trials and on the basis of confessions they say they were forced to make under torture.</span></div><div><span>“It is high time that the Iraqi authorities end this appalling cycle of abuse and declare a moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty for all crimes.”</span></div><div><span>Since December, thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in areas where Sunni Muslims are in the majority, to protest against arbitrary detention, abuses of detainees, the use of the anti-terror law, and an end to what they see as government discrimination against the Sunni population.</span></div><div><span>Meanwhile, Sunni armed groups continue to attack not only government targets but Shi’a civilians, including religious pilgrims.</span></div><div><span>Although the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northeast Iraq has remained largely free of the violence that has engulfed the rest of the country, its two ruling Kurdish political parties maintain a tight grip on power and incidents of detainee abuses have also been reported.</span></div><div><span>The removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003 should have been followed by a process of fundamental human rights reform but almost from day one the occupying forces began committing torture and other serious violations against prisoners, as the Abu Ghraib scandal involving U.S. forces and the beating to death of Baha Mousa in the custody of British soldiers in Basra graphically demonstrated,” said Hadj Sahraoui.</span></div><div><span>In the UK and the USA, despite investigations into individual cases, there has been a failure to investigate systematically the widespread human rights violations committed by forces from those countries, and to hold those responsible to account at all levels. Iraqi victims of U.S. human rights violations have found the route to remedy in the U.S. courts blocked.</span></div><div><span>The Iraqi authorities have periodically acknowledged torture and other ill treatment but they have generally sought to explain them away as isolated occurrences or, in a few high profile cases, have announced official inquiries whose outcomes, if any, subsequently were never revealed.</span></div><div><span>Yet, as Amnesty International’s report shows, torture and other abuse of detainees has been one of the most persistent and widespread features of Iraq’s human rights landscape, and the government shows little inclination either to recognize its extent or take the measures necessary to consign such grave abuses to the past.</span></div><div><span>Methods of torture reported by detainees include, electric shocks applied to the genitals and other parts of the body, partial suffocation by having a bag placed tightly over the head, beatings while suspended in contorted positions, deprivation of food, water and sleep, and threats of rape or that their female relatives will be detained and raped. Women detainees are particularly vulnerable and the report cites several cases in which women have alleged they were sexually abused in detention.</span></div><div><span>“Iraq remains caught in a cycle of torture and impunity that should long ago have been broken,” said Hadj Sahraoui. “It is high time the Iraqi authorities take the concrete steps needed to entrench a culture of human rights protection, and do so without further prevarication or delay.”</span><span></span></div>'),

However,  his boat can fit only one of the three in addition to him. If he leaves the wolf with the sheep, the wolf will eat the sheep. If he leaves the sheep with the lettuce, the sheep will eat the lettuce. So how does he move all three safely across the river? <a name="more"></a><br><br>This is a good metaphor for the current predicament facing Lebanon with regards to the parliamentary elections. Think of small parties/sects as the lettuce, for example Walid Jumblatt or Suleiman Frangieh.  Large parties/blocks like the FPM, Hezbollah or the Future Movement are either the wolf or the sheep, depending on which electoral law we’re discussing. The farmer used to be the Syrian regime but the position is now vacant, hence the confusion. <br><br>Electoral systems that are based on small districts favour the lettuces of Lebanese politics, but give them a disproportionate share of representation in relationship to their real levels of popular support. By contrast, larger districts mean that the lettuces will be gobbled up by the sheep, the wolves will take a bite off the sheep and might even be tempted to experiment with vegetarianism. <br><br>Since the end of the civil war, the powers to be have relied on highly creative forms of gerrymandering and devising composite systems to ensure some sort of balance between the wolves, the sheep and the lettuces. That creativity seems to have evaporated before the upcoming 2013 elections however, and there doesn’t seem to be any obvious way of manipulating the current system to ensure everyone remains pleased and un-devoured. <br><br>Hence the frantic attempts at devising a new system that guarantees our three passengers a safe journey across the river and makes the farmer’s life a little bit easier. A wide range of electoral laws has been proposed, ranging from the lettuce-centric to the pronouncedly wolverine. Here’s how they stack up on the lettuce-sheep-wolf scale: <br><br>At one end of the spectrum, there’s the ‘1960 Law’, small districts, winner takes all. It ‘protects’ the lettuces but, believe it or not, it gives large lettuces advantage over small lettuces because of the winner takes all aspect. Wolves and sheep lose some of their ‘road roller’ power, because the smaller districts weaken their ability to monopolise representation in large districts. <br><br>A step up, there’s the 2000 law which the default current system. A composite system based on small and large districts in different parts of the country, winner takes all. This is the most contorted system, the wolves reign supreme, the sheep benefit but resent the favours they have to demand from the wolves, and the lettuces are the mercy of the others. Some lettuces can exploit their sexiness to wolves however. <br><br>Boutros Draft Law. A hybrid system between simple majority in small districts and proportional representation on the large district level. Although it aims to pacify wolves, lettuces and sheep, it is seen as too unpredictable. (Who wants unpredictability in elections?) Although in theory it might be a step towards wider proportional representation. <br><br>Nation-wide proportional representation. Good for the wolves and the lettuces, but the sheep will complain because the wolves can take a bite off their share but they can’t the bite the lettuce in return. The Future Movement thinks it will lose seats to Hezbollah/Amal, the FPM and the LF think they will lose seats to both Hezbollah, Amal and the FM, and, depending on the threshold, smaller parties might have a chance at a breakthrough into parliament. Some unusual-looking lettuces might make it in. <br><br>The ‘Orthodox Law’. In its current draft, the Maronite wolves will eat up both the Maronite sheep and lettuces, and likewise for the Sunni and Shiite wolves. That’s not how the Maronites wolves see it though, they prefer to think it’s protecting them as Maronite lettuces and sheep from the Sunni and Shiite wolves. It might yield to unusual results primarily because people aren’t, er, sheep, and many will revolt against sectarian monopolies. <br><br>There are also various other proposals trying to create workable hybrids and achieve a reasonable balance between wolves, sheep and lettuces. <br><br>Barring any surprises, it seems that the farmer has decided not to cross the river any time soon, and wait for calmer waters.'),

مفهوم، مفهوم. كيف ستحبون أن تذكرون أياً منها والكثير من أساتذة لبنان بيقبضوا ٥٠٠,٠٠٠ ليرة؟ ينقلون العلم للأدمغة ولا يستطيعون نقل برميل مازوت الى بيوتهم الذي وصل سعره الى ٣٠٠,٠٠٠ ليرة. على فرض طبعاً انكم تمتعتم بعامٍ دراسي طبيعي<br>\nعماذا أخبركم إذاً؟<br>\n…لحظة، لحظة… موسيقى الخبر العاجل تصدح</p>\n<div align="center"><strong>:خبر عاجل<br></strong></div>\n<p dir="rtl">“وجدت القوى الأمنية ذرة أمل ملقاة في أحد أزقة بيروت المهمشة. وقد بدا أن ذرة الأمل هذه قد تعرضت لإعتداء وضرب مبرحين، مما إستدعى نقلها الى أحد مستشفيات المدينة للرعاية الصحية…”.</p>\n<div align="center"><strong>.أنا: منيح استقبلوها</strong></div>\n<p dir="rtl">“… وقد ذكر الطاقم الطبي أنه على الرغم من وصول ذرة الأمل في حال حرجة جداً، ما بين الحياة والموت، إلا أنها تمكنت من إعطاء افادتها عن الحادث. وحين سئلت عن المعتدين قالت أنتم، وحين سئلت كيف تمكنت من النجاة قالت أنتم… أنتم مرضي وأنا دواؤكم”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir="rtl">\n</p><p dir="rtl">نشرت في جريدة النهار- <a href="http://newspaper.annahar.com/article.php?t=ashabab&p=8&d=25012&dt=2013-03-07%2000:00:00">ملحق نهار الشباب</a> في ٧ اذار/مارس٢٠١٣</p>\n<p dir="rtl">نشرت على <a href="http://naharashabab.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88%D9%83/"> مدونة نهار الشباب</a> في ٩ اذار/ مارس ٢٠١٣</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href="http://whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/category/beirut/">Beirut</a>, <a href="http://whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/category/change/">Change</a>, <a href="http://whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/category/lebanon/">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/category/thoughts-opinions/">Thoughts & Opinions</a>, <a href="http://whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/category/%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%84/">عربي مشكل</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com/909/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=whenhopespeaks.wordpress.com&blog=38676767&post=909&subd=whenhopespeaks&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>'),

But several factors including uncertainty in Syria, a weak lebanese state, economic pressure and porous borders will likely result in a situation in which our Syrian guests will become a permanent fixture in Lebanese life. How would the Lebanese state cope with such a reality?</p>\n<h2>Home will wait</h2>\n<p>Many Syrians in Lebanon today don’t have anything to return to. Entire buildings and villages in Syria were leveled to the ground, homes were occupied, jobs and businesses have disappeared and loved ones were killed. By the time peace comes to Syria — and we could be talking many years from now — , Syrians in Lebanon will not rush to the exits the way we imagine they would. That will only happen when Syria becomes economically prosperous and creates jobs to spare, and that’s still far down the line.</p>\n<p>Some Lebanese understand that Syrian refugees will stay in Lebanon for a while, but they think that we can treat them the way we treated Palestinian refugees, ie isolate them in parallel lives with a miserable existence to encourage them to go home. But there are many reasons why Syrians are not like Palestinians and why that tactic will not work. </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sheer scale:</strong> One million Syrians is a huge number that is already significantly impacting the Lebanese economy. The number of Palestinian refugees is very manageable in comparison</li>\n<li><strong>Dispersion in Lebanon:</strong> Unlike Palestinian camps and unlike Syrian camps in Jordan and Turkey where refugees are clearly gathered in specialised camps, the Syrian refugees in Lebanon are all over the country living in villages, towns and cities with families, in stores, in churches, schools and mosques</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of national cause</strong> Unlike with the Palestinian cause where the Lebanese are united in their insistence that the Palestinians must go back home, many Lebanese won’t feel good about pressuring the Syrians to leave the country</li>\n</ul><h2>New Lives</h2>\n<p>It is dawning on many Syrians that they’re in this for the long haul. Young women are being married off to Lebanese men, and others are joining the Lebanese informal economy. Many of those who fled the war are educated, skilled, and experienced. Syrian doctors, teachers, engineers, artisans, bread makers and farmers are now selling their skills for very low prices in the Lebanese black market. This is  coinciding with a movement by organised labor in Lebanon to demand wage increases, which is creating an incentive for Lebanese households, business owners, farm owners and industrialists to take a look at the new vast pool of cheap and skilled Syrian labor.</p>\n<p>The Lebanese state and public opinion will resist this and attempt to crack down on it, but our state is not strong enough to impose its will on such large market forces. Remember, we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of people all over the country who are offering real skills for lower wages.</p>\n<h2>Denial</h2>\n<p>What is the government to do? One way is to ignore the problem and we have done this for a while. But now, we are really starting to feel the pressure and we’re trying to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/11/us-syria-crisis-lebanon-idUSBRE92A0JR20130311">guilt the world</a> into offloading the problem off our backs. But no matter how much the UNHCR and the entire world pour money into the problem, you can never take care of the daily needs of one million people. </p>\n<p>Something will have to give. We can decide to isolate and scorn them, but they’ll ignore us and join the informal economy and crime.

But it is unacceptable for some to be upset about political positions and expressions…, at a time <span><strong>when some states are fully implicated in the Syrian crisis</strong> </span>through armament, training, funding and interference on all levels…</p>\n<p>“[He added:] “Unfortunately, this is one of the consequences of Sykes-Picot. These Lebanese nationals are Sunnis, Shi’is and Christians, but most of them are Shi’is and their numbers amount to around 30,000. The latter were subjected to attacks and immense pressures in Al-Qusayr and its surrounding regions in Homs, and we feared they would be displaced inside the Lebanese territories or subjected to threats, especially in light of the kidnappings and killings that targeted them… We believed it was our duty as Hezbollah to help the latter protect their villages and towns, so that they can stay in them and are not displaced to Lebanon. We thus provided them with training, arms and help and we announced that to the public. We do not consider that this is interference in Syrian affairs. <strong>Quite the contrary, we blame the Syrian state for not doing anything to help its citizens who are present on Syrian soil…””</strong></p>\n<br><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mideastwire.wordpress.com&blog=13423679&post=2803&subd=mideastwire&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1">'),

Only last week, 2 friends of mine showed me messages they are getting from these random guys, sometimes accompanied with naked pictures or love songs. One of them even proposed to marry her and sent her his own picture (even though she never answered him back and always ignored his calls).</p>\n<p>I know that the best way is to just ignore these people but sometimes it can go on for weeks and the same person could be using several numbers which is why I think there should be an easy way to report such harassment acts and catch the people doing this. It’s not funny when a married woman gets a naked picture of another man on her phone or gets offered money in return for sex from a total stranger. The annoying part is that once that person knows your number, there are many ways he can reach you.</p>\n<p>Having said that, and based on what I’ve been told, the legal way to approach a harassment is by either going to the nearest Office of Public Prosecutions and filing a complaint or talking to a lawyer. Another “illegal” way is to have someone call the guy and pretend they are from the ISF Information Branch or Army intelligence Officers but I wouldn’t recommend it. In fact, the reason I know about this illegal method is because someone tried to do that with a well-connected relative of mine and ended up getting caught along with the guy he hired. Of course the girl can always call the guy or have her brother or boyfriend or father call him and warn him but that’s not the proper way to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Back to the main topic, I think there should be a hotline or website shared by the police and Telecom ministry dedicated to reporting harassing phone calls and texts. That way, people who are getting harassed will avoid the hassle to hire a lawyer or going to the Office of Public Prosecutions for a small yet serious matter. </p>\n<p>All they would have to do on the website for example is to submit a form accompanied with screenshots and the people in charge of this website or hotline would double check the information and then block the line or trace it to its owner and arrest him. If they report it via the hotline, the number would get a warning call.</p>\n<p>I will submit this request to Minister Sehnaoui since he’s the current Telecom Minister and other concerned parties to see if there’s anything they can do about it.</p>'),

You’re out of luck if you are a Roman tourist at this time of year – you can blame Benedict’s old age for that.</p>\n<p>As it is with papal elections, there is no clear frontrunner as of this point. The myth goes that the cardinals leave their choice to the holy spirit through copious amounts of prayers and holiness. That is if you believe the holy spirit is a combination of politics, geographic, demographics and whatnot.</p>\n<p>Eventually, any Pope nowadays is chosen based on one premise only: strengthening the position of the Catholic Church around the world. The late pope John Paul II led one of the biggest developments the Catholic Church had seen when it comes to the Youth, especially in popularity. Benedict’s undeclared job was to contain this surge that John Paul caused in a more Christian, usable, framework.</p>\n<p>Today, the Catholic church is stuck at the edge of a steep cliff with the following predicaments:</p>\n<ol><li><span>Decreasing worshippers across the world,</span></li>\n<li>Rise in Christian persecution in certain parts of the world,</li>\n<li>Sex-related scandals that plague Catholic priests more often than none,</li>\n<li>Corruption scandals that always seem to find a foothold,</li>\n<li>The issues of abortion, same-sex marriage and other thorny issues.</li>\n</ol><p>Seeing as the Catholic church is firm in its position regarding abortion, same-sex marriages (despite some recent breakthroughs in that regard), stem cell research and the like, I believe point #5 is not even an option in the voters’ mindset. Corruption and sex-related scandals are issues that Cardinals feel should be best kept in-house, not influencing the decision of choosing a Pope who will lead a Church not only based on those two criteria. The stances of the Catholic church regarding the many sex abuse cases that were revealed is a testament to that – if anything, it reminds me of typical elderly Lebanese women whose job in life is to cover up any wrongdoing in their family and showcase it to the world in positive light. Cardinals are similar to those elderly women in that regard.</p>\n<p>The most important framework for Cardinals voting today is the following: help Christians around the world stay Christians and lessen the numbers of Christians who are deciding not to be so anymore. There’s little that a Pope can do when it comes to decreasing worshippers – after all, how do you convince people who lack faith that they should have it? It’s impossible. But what the papal conclave of Cardinals can affect is the persecution of Christian minorities across the world, notably in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Pope Benedict’s XVI’s visit to Lebanon back in September – his last major visit to any country before his resignation – was not out of the blue. Him demanding Patriarch Raï to go to Syria and hold mass there, which sparked <a title="Insulting The Maronite Patriarch" href="http://stateofmind13.com/2013/02/14/insulting-the-maronite-patriarch/">an insane reaction</a>, was also not out of the blue. Small steps they may be, sure, but for the faithful who still cling to their belief despite the hardships, a patriarch or a Pope acknowledging their strife is some very important business.</p>\n<p>The question, therefore, asks itself: Could Patriarch Raï be the dark horse to be elected as the upcoming Pope?</p>\n<p>Many Lebanese have already set Facebook pages to that effect, out of enthusiasm mostly, as if a liking a Facebook page to demand our patriarch be instated as Pope is actually beneficial or worth it. But that’s how things are with us – we always take things to Facebook.</p>\n<p>However, I have thought about it lately and come to conclude that Mr. Raï could have a decent, albeit slight chance, at becoming the world’s next Pope for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol><li>If the main focus is to target the persecution of Christians in the world, what better option than the head of the Christian majority in the location where Christians are targeted the most? The Middle East.</li>\n<li>Former pope Benedict’s XVI’s visit to Lebanon was, in part, to sign the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20120914_ecclesia-in-medio-oriente_en.html">text</a>) in which the Vatican goes on and on about the crucial importance of the Church in the Middle East.</li>\n<li>A Pope from the Middle East would set the wheels for true Muslim-Christian dialogue, which is what this deeply religious and troubled region needs and the Vatican knows this.</li>\n<li>Patriarch Raï is age appropriate to be pope. He is <em>only</em> 73. He also speaks several languages fluently, as is required of Lebanese bishops.</li>\n<li>Patriarch Raï does not come from a country where priest sex scandals are aplenty and being relatively unknown to the vote has a rather “cleaner” slate than his counterparts. He was also elected as an assistant to the interim Pope over the past week.</li>\n</ol><p>The reasons may not be supremely compelling to have someone become Pope, sure. But they’re still viable enough to put Mr. Raï on the papal map. I’m not even sure if Mr. Raï can be a good pope but he might become one.  And frankly, him getting elected sort of scares me.</p>'),

This time the theme was “strictly decorative”. It is all about what the Elie Saab woman has to face when keeping up with modern times. Crepe satin jumpsuits, high-waisted trousers, sheer silk chiffon blouses: many of this items were presented amongst the first looks, giving to this collection a lot of weight when to ready-to-wear everyday looks. As for the night, the creations are much more feminine. Bands of lace, meticulous beadings, silk, sequins…everything was there. I liked the yellow he introduced, it adds up a little of sun to a very wintery mood. My favorite part of the show is when black and white looks succeeded each others. I’m in love with the white suits, they’re just fabulous and they remind us of old-hollywood glamour. I would so imagine Grace Kelly rocking one of these. As for the black dresses, each one of them is a masterpiece, classics that could live eternally in your closets.<br><a href="http://www.larmoiredelana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_1081.jpg"

Replacing the son’s first name with the word “Yo2borné”.<br>\n2. Obsessive tendency to call Yo2borné every hour to check if he’s eaten and rested.<br>\n3. Correlation between her bedtime and Yo2borné’s even if this means going to sleep at 6am (when he gets back home after a wild party), or not sleeping at all.<br>\n4. Underestimation of every girl Yo2borné dates, beginning with her looks (even if she looks like Megan Fox) to her level of intelligence (even if she is a PhD candidate or a CEO of a reputable company).<br>\n5. Unfounded suspicions that Yo2borné’s wife is not feeding him. (Even if he has developed a big Kerech since he got married)<br>\n6. Irrational feeling of anxiety if Yo2borné is 10 minutes late, accompanied by dramatic imaginings of potential accident scenarios.<br>\n7. Intense and spontaneous outbursts of weeping in the following situations:<br>\n• When Yo2borné catches the flu (even if his 5 sisters are sick as well).<br>\n• If Yo2borné travels for a few short days (even if this is the case every month, and has been the case for the past 5 years).<br>\n8. Unexplained competitive behavior with his girlfriend or wife in the following fields: cooking, washing, ironing and cleaning.<br>\n9. Deep belief that human beings can reproduce themselves without a partner. (This symptom usually manifests after Yo2borné begins having cute children of his own who only have HIS geneschu nsito enno l 2ered bi 3eyn 2emmo ghazel?)<br>\n10. Permanent attempts to please Yo2borné and create a perfect world for him, ignoring the rest of the family, and normally associating “Yes” as a chronic answer to all of his demands.\n</p></blockquote>');

Well, City Centre is almost complete and is set to open on <strong>April 4, 2013.</strong> There are dozens of new brands and to name a few I, and many of you guys are excited about: Victoria’s Secret, The Cheesecake Factory, Carrefour and Shake Shack!</p>\n<p>Today, I managed to take a quick peak into the mall bustling with dozens of construction workers, architects and engineers working well beyond normal hours of business to finalize this mega-mall by April 4.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130312_173736.jpg"><img alt="20130312_173736" src="http://ginoraidy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/20130312_173736.jpg?w=610&h=457" width="610" height="457"></a></p>\n<p>One thing I was extremely happy about was finding out Fatburger is also setting up shop in City Centre! Fatburger is my favorite burger joint in California. It’s a chill, laid-back ”burger stand” which has a really, really good burger. So, that’s a plus to this otherwise mega-leak of the interior of City Centre Beirut.</p>\n<p>I’m going to try to go again and find out where Victoria’s Secret, The Cheesecake Factory, Carrefour and Shake Shack are opening exactly (how big the venues are, indoors or outdoors, etc.) And try to find out if anything else is a “first” for Beirut in this new mall or worth “leaking”.</p>\n\n<a

Are they seriously filming a ten year old and asking him what he thinks of the Syrian refugees in the country and taking what he said as relevant enough to actually be included? </p>\n<p>The way many of the people in the above video formulated their opinion regarding the refugees is unacceptable. But what is also unacceptable is for others to say that the concerns these people tried to convey are 1) racist and 2) invalid. Because, you know, Lebanon is very new to refugees. Those Syrians are obviously the first people we host and their problems are so new we cannot even begin to think dealing with them because of their novelty factor.</p>\n<p>It is not only normal to have concerns regarding the refugee situation in Lebanon, it is, in my opinion, the sane thing to do. We cannot keep pretending that 1,000,000 Syrians in the country (Or 300,000 according to UN) is a walk in the park, with no prospective effects and no current effects in any way. </p>\n<p>If you mention the Lebanese people who lost their rented homes because their landlords got better offers from Syrians, you are racist. If you mention the jobs that skillful Syrian physicians, accountants, architects and whatnot took out of Lebanese people, you are racist. The list goes on. It is obviously not the Syrians’ fault but it is an effect that some people don’t want to allow us to discuss. Because racism, racism everywhere. </p>\n<p>When does this categorization of Lebanese who are critical of the current situation stop? </p>\n<p>On the other hand, the categorization against the Syrians is unacceptable as well. Our country’s problems are not dependent on them and them alone. Not feeling safe while walking on a street is not because of the Syrians but because Lebanon is not a safe country with or without them. You can read this story that a friend of mine had to go through while walking in Gemmayze (<a href="http://stateofmind13.com/2012/07/18/a-girls-walk-around-gemmayze-beirut/">link</a>). The economical situation in the country is less the fault of the refugees and more the fault of politicians who are perpetuating the current political instability. </p>\n<p>The borders should not and will not be closed for they are non existent and it would be grossly inhumane. The Syrians don’t want to come here. They are forced to come here. There is no way to regulate their influx as I had said before (<a href="http://stateofmind13.com/2013/01/05/the-uncontrolled-influx-of-syrian-refugees-to-lebanon-must-stop/">link</a>). They are here knocking at our doors with a riffle in their backs. If we don’t let them in, they get shot. There is no Syrian <em>civilian</em> entry to Lebanon that is not an emergency. The only thing that we, as Lebanese, can do regarding the refugees is have discussions. </p>\n<p>The Syrians hosted some of our people in 2006. Of course they did. And we are thankful. But them hosting us back then is akin to a billionaire giving a poor person $100 and asking him to be eternally grateful for that. They were able to handle the thousands of Lebanese that entered their territory for a period of about three weeks.</p>\n<p>Lebanon, a country that can’t even handle someone like Ahmad el Assir or even the poverty of people in places like Bab el Tebbane and Akkar and the South, cannot handle one million extra person who need help.</p>\n<p>It is a Lebanese’s right to be wary and worried and apprehensive. The way that worried Lebanese formulates his or her worry and apprehension may differ and it may be unacceptable but those who don’t feel this way are similar to an ostrich with its head so far down the sand it can’t even manage to get it out anymore.</p>\n<p>Now cue in those will call me racist.

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=zLgVJ0h5m0o">first one</a> is by <em>Annahar</em> newspaper, where Lebanese citizens on the street were expressing resentment over the amounts of Syrians in the country (a topic that I wrote about in my <a href="http://beirutspring.com/blog/2013/03/11/the-big-denial/">previous article</a>), and our country’s inability to cope. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwaw9-_YNM">second video</a> is a response to that video, basically shaming the people in the first video for being a bunch of racist haters. As I watched the second video, I realized that although there are some reasons for concern, critics are confusing economic resentment with racism. </p>\n<h2>Resentment</h2>\n<p>The kind of economic resentment expressed in <em>Annahar’s</em> video is an international phenomenon. It is happening in the USA (resentment of cheap Mexican labor and resentment of outsourcing to places like India). It is happening in Europe (resentment of cheap Turkish and north African employees), and it’s even happening in Africa, where people are beginning to resent cheap imported Chinese labor. </p>\n<p>This phenomenon happens when a country with relatively well paid middle class gets an inflow of “foreigners” who can do the same jobs of locals but who get paid much less. The resentment happens when people begin to realize that the government’s salaries and services are becoming scarcer. The X amount of dollars that the government used to spend on free schooling and health care will now have to be divided among a larger group of people. Salaries go down and services begin to deteriorate as schools get more pupils and hospitals get longer waiting lines. Employers begin laying off Lebanese employees in favor of cheaper –and sometimes better– Syrian employees. This creates resentment, and people will start saying that they are more deserving of the government’s limited resources. </p>\n<p><strong>The key here is to understand <em>why</em> people think they deserve the government’s money more than the foreigners. It’s not because they are racist, haters, or chauvinists. It’s because unlike the foreigners, the Lebanese pay taxes to the government, and it is those taxes that pay for services that are now being shared.</strong> </p>\n<p>Ironically, the people who are most enthusiastically sharing the second video on facebook are the same people who support the union movement, a movement that would declare war on the government if it decided to employ Syrian teachers instead of Lebanese ones in public schools. Would that make the union movement “racist?”.</p>\n<h2>Real racism</h2>\n<p>Real racism is when people fundamentally believe that they are better than other people for superficial reasons like skin color or accent. For example, banning dark-skinned people from swimming in Lebanese pools is a real form of racism. Not all the people in Annahar’s video are innocent (some exhibit a real racist discomfort with the other), but complaining that you couldn’t get a job or government service because of others is not racism.</p>\n<div>\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:D7DqB2pKExk"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:D7DqB2pKExk" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?i=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?a=N2nnfmM-nWs:vMIFdHWngOs:J3aVl1i_38o"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/beirutspring/fb_feed?d=J3aVl1i_38o" border="0"></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/beirutspring/fb_feed/~4/N2nnfmM-nWs" height="1" width="1">'),

The campaign failed to cause a buzz; people saw it once, had a fast laugh but the approach kept them passive.</p>\n<p>Being as subjective as we always were, Text&Talk opens up new horizons for Touch as a brand from one side, and for local advertising from the other. The use of a silent movie, the art direction, the storyline, the cast, the acting skills, and the whole insightful approach related to our Lebanese habit of ‘miss-calling’ work together meticulously (disregarding the fact that we stopped this habit when Whatsapp hit us). The campaign is spot on, an eye candy that deserves both thumbs-up just because of the amount of ballvertising it evolves. Guys, it’s not easy to do such an ad, it’s even more difficult to convince a client to pay for a risky job.</p>\n<p>Whether effective or not (NOT), we can’t but encourage more experimentation on the level of guts in advertising.

The violence now raging across the country often seems random and inexplicable but it isn’t. If you want to understand what’s happening in Syria and this region at the moment there’s only one place to start, and that’s in the past. Those fighting for control of Syria nurse grievances stretching back centuries.’</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>I watched Dan Snow’s documentary ‘A History of Syria’ (BBC Two, 11 March), in which he tried to explain the historic roots of the on-going conflict there. Snow had clearly delved deep into Syrian history and tried to understand the dynamics of what’s happening today, travelling to various parts of Syria and talking to both pro and anti-regime Syrians. Unfortunately, his conclusions were distorted by his overreliance on historic precedents and the extent to which past grievances are dictating what’s happening today.</div><a name="more"></a> <br><div><br></div><div>The documentary is still worth watching, (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01rb2st/This_World_A_History_of_Syria_with_Dan_Snow/">catch it here on iPlayer</a>), but it’s a missed opportunity to examine the historic aspects of the Syrian conflict without falling into the trap of deterministic sectarian narratives. Snow’s argument, in a nutshell, is that the historic grievances between Alawites and Sunnis are directly responsible for the conflict raging in Syria today. </div><div><br></div><div>Snow cites the historic persecution of Alawites at the hand of Sunni rulers and finds parallels with the anti-Alawite rhetoric and the accusations of heresy levelled against them by some Sunni clerics. (He interviews one such cleric in Tripoli, Lebanon.) In parallel, he identifies the bloody suppression of the 1982 revolt in Hama by Assad Sr. as a cause for the Sunni desire for revenge which he argues influenced the path of the Syrian uprising. </div><div><br></div><div>No one can deny the sectarian aspect of the Syrian civil war, but like many before him Snow is wrong in attributing cause and effect. Framing the conflict in terms of long-standing sectarian animosities makes it sound like another inevitable episode in a history of violence and revenge. That is a common form of fatalistic determinism among many Middle East observers and analysts. In reality, the sectarian tone, while never entirely absent, became more apparent in response to the violent suppression of the uprising and the subsequent militarisation of the opposition. </div><div><br></div><div>This wasn’t inevitable. Sectarian mobilisation and alarmism about existential threats surfaced in the absence of cross-sectarian political narratives and the regime’s response to peaceful demonstrations. But the paralysis of social and political life in Syria for decades was bound to impact on the ability to form such narratives and the ability of new national leaders to emerge and play a role in the uprising. But it’s by no means a rehearsal of an ancient history repeating itself, that is simplistic. </div><div><br></div><div>Snow, on the other hand, was right to identify how the Syrian conflict was aggravated by external meddling:</div><div><b>But there’s also another echo from Syria’s long history that’s prolonging the current conflict. Syria is once again at the centre of a struggle involving global and regional powers for control over its future.  Russia and Shiite Iran support Assad’s regime while Sunni Arab states and the west increasingly back elements of the opposition. </b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>The great forces of Syrian history are fuelling a bitter war. East versus west, Sunni versus Alawite, secularism versus religion, democracy versus authoritarianism. The threads running through this conflict mean that there’s no simple solution. All Syrians are now asking what the future holds for their country. </b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>But he over-dramatized the nature of that meddling in presenting it as a replay of past global struggles over Syria. External actors have inflamed the situation, but driven less by those ‘timeless’ struggles than immediate concerns that remain largely ambiguous and confused. Two years on for example and the US is no nearer to formulating a clear policy on Syria. Yet, hapless meddling from all sides has tragic consequences. </div><div>At the end, Snow tried to find a ray of hope in Syria’s tradition of tolerance:<b></b></div><div><br></div><div><b>But for now there’s no current end in sight for the current violence which has left a military stalemate on the ground. Ultimately Syria’s different communities are going to have to talk and work out a way of living alongside each other again to prevent the country’s total destruction. But Syria’s long history shows that this, at least, is possible. </b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>But that is also a dangerous conclusion, although one that is gaining currency fast. In seeing the conflict between Syrians as one between communities, the solution is increasingly being seen in terms of a communitarian peace deal. (Akin to what happened in Lebanon). That means the political nature of the conflict will be subsumed by a deal that will enshrine communitarianism within Syria’s future. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div>'),

The waiter suggested cheese and turkey, so I asked if they were out of ham or something, he ensured me that that specific branch does not serve pork.

The franchisee might have every right to do that in his/her own brand, but when I go into a ZwZ, I expect the ZwZ menu, not the Muslim Brotherhood one.</p>\n<p>The service was amazing and the staff was the best ZwZ staff I’ve seen, but whoever franchised this branch, is obviously a religious radical who I can assure you, will never see my business again. I don’t like people telling me what I can and cannot do based on their personal beliefs, especially when they don’t warn me of their radicalism before I take a seat at their establishment.</p>\n<p>I understand extremists will behave that way, and so I won’t give the franchisee much lip, after all, why would I expect anything better from someone so backward?

This isn’t about me being raised a Christian, I am an atheist, and ardent in my lack of belief in gods and religions and find it extremely insulting that I don’t have a choice of what to eat when it’s listed on the menu. I’m not forcing anyone to eat pork and drink beer, but I utterly despise someone telling me I can’t. Let people choose.</p>\n<p>So, despite the great service and kind-hearted staff, I cannot but blacklist this branch for refusing to serve items on the menu for religious purposes, without giving customers prior knowledge before going in.</p>\n<p></p>'),

And he’s awesome at it. You know why? Because of all the times we’ve discussed religion, which is very often and on so many occasions I’ve lost track, he has never insulted a religion. He doesn’t believe in them, as is his right, but he knows it’s not it’s not right trash them left and right, ridicule every single person who believes in those religions in which he does not believe.</p>\n<p>The most famous slogan that gets thrown around a lot goes like this: “Religion is like a penis. It’s fine to have one and it’s fine to be proud of it but it’s not fine to shove it down my throat.”</p>\n<p>This is a saying that I not only believe in, I also believe it is of utmost necessity. I also believe the aforementioned statement should be affixed to become the following: “Your personal beliefs are like a penis. It’s fine to have one and it’s fine to be proud of it but it’s not fine to shove it down my throat.”</p>\n<p>Some Lebanese atheists – and some atheists around the world to be fair – fall into that category by becoming exactly like the religious people they despise: people who do nothing but shove their beliefs down people’s throats. And they believe it’s okay to do so.</p>\n<p>The white smoke erupting from the Vatican Chimney was more exciting than Christmas morning for some Lebanese atheists. <em>Habemus Pedofilus</em> was the first thing I saw being floated around. Digging deeper, it turned out the pun on <em>Habemus Papam</em> (We now have a pope) was the least “creative” of attacks against Christianity.</p>\n<p>And it’s not only the Church that’s affected. Whenever an Islamist does anything out of the ordinary, which is much more common in these parts of the world than anything Church related, that Islamist’s entire religion and sect become fair play.</p>\n<p>As a non-deeply religious person, I understand how difficult it is to be as such in this country and in this region. I only need suggestions to pray more in order to start having my anxiety rise. I understand that atheism in this part of the world is still considered a taboo, less so in Lebanon obviously. But ridiculing people of the opposite bank isn’t how you make them float towards you not necessarily to become atheists like you but to at least accept you as their equal counterparts in a society that doesn’t even want to acknowledge your existence.</p>\n<p>With every offensive tweet, Facebook status, proclamation that makes some Lebanese atheists proud of themselves for all the snarkiness they exude, there are many more atheists who are done a disservice and damaged in the process – atheists who welcomed the new Pope’s arrival with congratulating all their Catholic friends because they are truly and sincerely happy for them, regardless of how silly they think their Catholic friends are for being as such.</p>\n<p>Those atheists, like my friend, have their image tainted by the sporadic vocal atheist here and there that feel it is their divine (or not) right and goal in life to bash every single religion and religious person who is still wasting precious oxygen.</p>\n<p>You think religion is the root of all evil? You have every right to. You don’t want to be religious? I’ll be the first person to champion for that right. You don’t want religion shoved down your throat? Avoid it. You can ask me for tips on how to do so. You want to try and persuade someone that going atheist is the way? Be their guest.</p>\n<p>There is an approach to how you communicate your message across and some Lebanese atheists are failing terribly at it.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the pope they ridiculed before even knowing who he was, pope Francesco I is an Argentinian who rides the subway, doesn’t like personal help, is a good cook and has visited a hospital in 2001 where he washed and kissed the feet of 12 terminally ill people with AIDS. He lives with one lung and is 76 years old. He is obviously against same-sex marriage and abortion but did anyone really expect otherwise?</p>\n<p>Pope Francesco makes me, and many atheists with whom I had brief discussions after his grand reveal, hopeful that things might change for the better in the Vatican. But don’t let some Lebanese atheists hear anyone say something along those lines. Their blood becomes halal. Or maybe something Darwinian.</p>'),

Even Drezner’s most provocative case was that simply <a href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/02/08/the_end_of_power">compellence power was on the wane</a>, while <a href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/02/08/the_end_of_power">Naim makes a much grander argument</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Power is shifting -- from\nlarge, stable armies to loose bands of insurgents, from corporate leviathans to\nnimble start-ups, and from presidential palaces to public squares. But power is\nalso changing, becoming harder to use and easier to lose. As a result, argues\naward-winning columnist and former <em>Foreign Policy</em> editor Moisés Naím,\nall leaders have less power than their predecessors, and the potential for\nupheaval is unprecedented. In <em>The End of Power</em>, Naím illuminates the\nstruggle between once-dominant megaplayers and the new micropowers challenging\nthem in every field of human endeavor. The antiestablishment drive of\nmicropowers can topple tyrants, dislodge monopolies, and open remarkable new\nopportunities, but it can also lead to chaos and paralysis. Drawing on\nprovocative, original research and a lifetime of experience in global affairs,\nNaím explains how the end of power is reconfiguring our world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nMy suspicion, actually, is that Naim here is wrong about the existence of a\nserious redistribution of <em>relative power</em> (<em>absolute power </em>and <em>capabilities</em>\nare another matter), from “big” to “small” concentrations, particularly where\norgans of state power are concerned, and especially at a macro-historical scale\nof analysis.<br><br>\nNaim’s arguments about the decline in the prevalence of traditional forms of\npower draw from a broader intellectual trend. Given the audience of this blog,\naddressing the supposed military shift in power and combat strength is\nworthwhile. Here, in fact, I think we find that describing a systemic shift\nfrom power from states and their armies to insurgents and their looser\nstructures is misleading.<br><br>\nRemember that the most recent great powers to fall to revolutionary insurgents\nof any kind were Russia to its Revolution and China to its Civil War. Already\nwe have quite a strong indication that the most important actors in the\ntraditionalist school of power are relatively resilient to existential risks\nfrom insurgent groups. Furthermore, to simply describe the fall of many\nafflicted regimes as simply insurgency overpowering traditional armies is\nhighly misleading.<br><br>\nInsurgencies still strongly benefit from foreign great power military\nintervention and support. In the cases of Russia and China, the effects of\nWorld Wars I and II played a major role in undermining state capacity or\nundermining governing coalitions. The insurgents of the Cold War era frequently\nbenefited from state patronage. The process of combating state resources\nfrequently drives insurgent groups to behave more like states and outcompete\nthem, in anticipation of creating a new one or capturing that of their foe.\nThis makes it in part a case selection problem. Highly successful insurgencies\nquickly take on the function or role of a state and outgrow their insurgent\nstage. The Taliban did a relatively good job at suppressing insurgency when\nthey were the nominal government, and their renewed ability to mobilize combat\npower makes them formidable insurgents, too.<br><br>\nIt is also important to differentiate examples of a non-state actor violently usurping\nthe coercive power of the state from constituent elements of a state’s\ngoverning coalition of elites and institutions turning on the regime. Here,\nboth Naim’s insistence that “micropowers” are toppling regimes and Drezner’s\nspeculation that compelling force can no longer cost-effectively kill its way\nto control needs strong qualification. In Egypt, the military stood aside in a\ngambit to preserve its political power, while the Muslim Brotherhood, though\npowerful, is expanding its power by co-opting state institutions. To say that\nstates, as a general proposition, are losing power to non-state actors is\nmisleading when states are diverse assemblages of political actors and\ninstitutions.<br><br>\nCompellence worked quite well for Bahrain and Saudi Arabia against their Shia\nminorities, while it is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/world/middleeast/signs-of-strain-on-syrias-military-build.html">starting to wane for the Assad regime</a> against\nrebels representing its excluded majority, but the regime’s killing strategy is\nnot failing simply because killing to control cannot work, but because the\nrebels are returning the favor in kind, and would greatly like more support or\ndirect action from foreign states to speed along this process. There have always\nbeen high costs to violently compelling your population into submission - just\nask the regimes which survived 1848 or Abraham Lincoln. In any case, without\nconsidering the components of compelling power - the political coalitions and\nthe demographic, geographic, and logistical factors which shape their ability\nto exert power, as well as the broader international system which engages in\nthe conflict - I question the utility of arguing one kind of group or one kind\nof power is declining in power in a more abstract, sweeping sense.<br><br>\nOne could pose the problem this way - there are many more states in the\ninternational arena today than there were during past periods. Many of them\nformed <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/States_and_Power_in_Africa.html?id=C1sIrGeCYScC">under vastly different conditions</a> than the\nostensibly traditional “Weberian” or “Westphalian” varieties. Many “failed” or\n“fragile” states were never that strong to begin with, and arguably\nstate-instituted <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo12322273.html">border fixity</a> encourages weak states and\npotent insurgencies. and were at risk to predatory state behavior as well as\ninsurgency, which reinforce each other when states foment insurgencies and\ncoups to wage proxy war.<br><br>\nSo, we could say there are more states predisposed to vulnerability to\ninsurgent groups (they are also, as Libya shows, even more vulnerable to\ntraditional power) than before. We could also say that insurgent groups and\nnon-state actors possess more capabilities, in absolute terms, than their\npredecessors did. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front obviously possesses more\nfirepower than did the Moros fighting the U.S. in the 1900s, and the Chechen\nsecessionist fighters and suicide bombers possess more firepower than 19th\ncentury Caucasian tribes and anarchist bombthrowers. So do modern armies have\noptions for projecting power against insurgent groups they never did before.<br><br>\nBetter than framing power as “ending” and states as declining would be to frame\nthe problem as an issue of policy relevance. Historically, the states are more\nprevalent before, and the U.S. and European militaries has relative power\nprojection capabilities that the imperial powers of the 15th-17th centuries\nwould envy (as <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300082852">Jeremy Black pointed out,</a> non-Western armies frequently rebuffed\nwould-be conquerors during this period). However, the <em>salience</em> of\ninsurgent groups and other violent non-state actors is obviously greater than\nin recent history, especially the salience of distant groups.\nState-versus-state violence is declining not because states are less militarily\ncapable, but because the aggregation of those capabilities and the political\ncontext reduces the incentives and likelihood for state-versus-state war.\nFrance and Germany could do far more damage to each other than Shabaab or MUJAO\ncould do to either of them, but this concern is far less salient than insurgent\ngroups.<br><br>\nThe important thing to recognize, however, is that today’s focus on violent\nnon-state actors is not the product of a systemic change in the way power is\nwielded, but because of mutable and discretionary choices about policy.\nCompellence and killing power too, are doing just fine, it’s simply a matter of\ncase selection and baseline standards. The U.S. could adopt a policy and\nsubsequent military strategies to move away from fighting VNSAs, but because\nthe U.S. is more concerned about al Qaeda as a security threat than it is about\nChina. China could still wreak far more havoc to American interests than al\nQaeda could. Nevertheless, because of VNSAs expanded capabilities and our\nexpanded scope of policy concerns, which increasingly includes areas more\nvulnerable to VNSA action, these groups have a higher degree of salience in policy\ncalculations even tho<br><br>\nMilitary preparedness is the product, in large part, of choices about force\nstructures and strategies. Our military’s frustration with fighting insurgents\nin Iraq does not imply insurgencies are now more potentially dangerous than\nChina, anymore than it implies cyberwarfare sabotage is a greater potential\ndanger than nuclear weapons. They are simply more <em>likely</em> issues as a\nproduct of the systemic environment. Recognizing what is the more likely risk,\nand thus the higher priority, for our preferred policies is a more useful way\nof thinking about power and its wielders rather than drawing sweeping\ninferences from narrowly selected cases.</p>'),

I didn’t need anyone to teach me; I have the internet. I did my research, watched a couple a YouTube videos and bought the essentials: a ball of yarn and a crochet hook. (Both cost less than LBP 10.000 if you want to start with basic quality). That’s all it took to get me hooked.</p>\n<p>After my <a href="http://wp.me/pUd8z-1XI">crochet project 1</a>, I found that liked it. It was quite simple in fact and easier than I thought. Soon, the women in the family took interest in what I did simply because I was not mimicking the “old table cloth patterns” but I was going for patterns that could be used and worn, neck warmers, shawls, gloves, clothes and even amigurumi.</p>\n<p>Later, I was told that crochet used to be a very popular craft in my village; in fact every woman had to learn before getting married and at a certain point, during the war, it was a means to support their families and save them from famine.</p>\n<p>There is not much information about the history of crochet, but what already exists  shows some of its evolution;</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://love-crochet.com/features/a-history-of-crochet.html">A brief history of crochet </a></li>\n<li><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?History-of-Crochet-1500-BC---1820&id=85872">History of Crochet 1500 BC – 1820</a></li>\n</ul><p>Crochet has its own language and symbols.

The reason was not explained to him in the branch but ZWZ justified this ban by linking it to “leasing conditions”.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Gino wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I sat down, ordered a ham and cheese mankooshe. The waiter suggested cheese and turkey, so I asked if they were out of ham or something, he ensured me that that specific branch does not serve pork. I ordered something else “halal” and then asked for an Almaza, he said alcohol was not served at that branch either.

We couldn’t miss the opportunity to open there and let our customers enjoy the experience we have to offer. However, we had to do some amendments on our menu in order to still be able to cater to our loyal fans, while respecting the leasing conditions.</p>\n<p>Adaptability and respect of others’ opinions are an integral part of the ZWZ culture. Our objective is to reach all customers in all regions while serving safe and delicious food.</p>\n<p>Finally, we’d love to see you all in our other close branches, such as Bliss, Gemmayze or Sodeco, where you can enjoy our full menu, no exception whatsoever!</p>\n<p>Have a great day ahead.</p>\n<p>Zaatar W Zeit Team. [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zaatarwzeit?ref=stream">Source</a>] </p></blockquote>\n<p>Now this may seem reasonable if this was a franchise but Zaatar W Zeit clearly stated that all ZWZ stores in Lebanon are owned by one company and thus aren’t franchised. If that’s the case, the question that comes to mind is whether it is legal to set leasing conditions of this type on a restaurant. Can’t they point out that there’s pork in some items (like they do now with the little piglet) and let customers decide if they want it or not? Where’s the harm in that? </p>\n<p>Last but not least, the branch is not that far away from a street filled with pubs and bars that obviously serve alcohol and people who go there are the most likely to be visiting the ZWZ branch after a long drinking night, add to that LAU students so I am not sure who they are trying to reach with this ban. </p>\n<p>If I were ZWZ, I would have simply picked another spot in Hamra.</p>\n<p><img src="http://blogbaladi.com/images/pork1-425x370.png" alt="pork" width="425" height="370"><br><em>One of ZWZ’s best sandwiches, Ham & Cheese and no it’s not the same if you replace the ham with turkey.</em></p>'),

Khaled doubted that a leftist would be allowed to reach a leading position in such a system. Khodor Salameh wrote a remarkable analysis on his Facebook  page drawing a comparison between Pope Jean Paul II and Francis I asking if the new pope is chosen in this particular time to break the alliance between the church in South America and the new left, as the Polish Pope was chosen to play a big role in fragmenting the Socialist block in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Whether the new pope is a real friend of the poor or “just another white man”  , it is too early to judge… only time will show.

Here’s a small brief on what happened:</p>\n<p>A tender to build a new power production unit at the Deir Amar facility was initially won by Abener-Butec, a Spanish-Lebanese consortium few months back. The contract was estimated at $662 million dollars, which according to Energy Minister Gebran Bassil, exceeded the $502 million allocated to fund Deir Ammar’s reconstruction.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the tender, Energy Minister is allowed to seek a 10% reduction from the winning company, and Abener-Butec agreed to these terms by downsizing the capacity of the new plant from 535 megawatts to 430 megawatts, but refused to cut down the contract by $160 million, which kind of makes sense. [<a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2013/Mar-12/209710-consortium-denies-lawsuit-over-power-plant-deal.ashx#axzz2NaRj8UTg">DailyStar</a>]</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You cannot ask us to deduct more than 10 percent of the total costs of the project, because if we were able to reduce costs more than that then how much profit would we be making? We’d be stealing from the government,” Zakharia said (Myrna Zakharia, Butec’s PR and communications adviser).</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don’t quite understand why did the government chose Abener-Butec’s offer in the first place if they knew they were above the amount allocated to fund Deir Ammar’s reconstruction. We are talking about international companies here with a reputation to keep, not some local bid over few thousand dollars. What’s gonna happen now is that the first tender got cancelled and a second one was open.</p>\n<p>Added to that, it seems the Spanish Company’s offer was <a href="http://www.businessnews.com.lb/cms/Story/StoryDetails.aspx?ItemID=2450">apparently</a> an excellent one:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The offer Abener-Butec had made gave a really good price, even lower than what the ministry had expected,” said Younes. The consortium’s offer set the cost of producing one Kilowatt at $1,262 when using heavy fuel and $1,170 when using gas. Younes said the consortium’s offer also maintained high-quality implementation: “Our competitors were Indian, Turkish, and Chinese companies, our offer was the best, in terms of value and quality.” </p></blockquote>\n<p>I am not sure how solid is Abener-Butec’s case legally speaking, since no contract was signed yet, but we might end up getting unofficially blacklisted by international companies because of that.</p>'),

His shock t...', 'stateofmind13', 1363332180, '<p>Gino Raidy’s encounter at ZWZ’s Hamra Branch went viral across Lebanon’s internet community very fast. His shock that a restaurant like ZWZ, infamous for his Halloumi bacon sandwiches, would actually have a branch that wouldn’t serve anything non-conformant with Islamic sharia sparked some huge debate as is evident by the extensive response to his post which you can read <a href="http://ginosblog.com/2013/03/13/blacklisted-zaatar-w-zeit-hamra-branch-refuses-to-serve-pork-and-alcohol-on-the-menu/">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It is beyond perfectly understandable that such an issue would be considered by many as infringing on their basic freedom of eating whatever they want to eat. It is also beyond ironic that ZWZ Hamra might as well be the go-to restaurant for Lebanese pub-goers who drink themselves away a few meters away in Hamra’s infamous alleyway and other pubs.</p>\n<p>So why would Islamic sharia be up and running in one place and completely shattered in another place? ZWZ’s diplomatic reply to the matter alluded to their leasing conditions: the person from whom they got their lease doesn’t allow pork and alcohol on the premises of his building and ZWZ had to conform.</p>\n<p>The question, therefore, asks itself: couldn’t have ZWZ opened elsewhere?</p>\n<p>The answer is: most probably not.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to preach regarding the matter but the fact of the matter remains that landlords have the upper hand in cosmopolitan places like Hamra (despite what Homeland’s producers want you to believe) because of the extremely high demand for property and the low supply. Whatever a landlord wants, a landlord gets. And most companies have to deal with is as such despite their better judgement.</p>\n<p>The fix for this is, obviously, stricter governmental regulations. But in a country where such an issue comes at possibly the lowest of importance in woes, such regulations will not be enforced anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The issue, though, is not in disassociation with the general mood of the country.</p>\n<p>This vigilante sharia applying is unacceptable. I’m not entirely sure if it’s legal as well. Is it allowed for someone to enforce something on their own property that is not legal across Lebanon? My gut tells me no. But Lebanese law has these sporadic eccentricities that make it baffling. And regardless of whether it’s legal or not, what is actually legal in Lebanon and is actually applied?</p>\n<p>The only urban planning law that I know of pertaining to this matter is banning alcohol sales within a certain radius of any prayer house, including Churches. Christian areas do not conform with it while places like Tripoli apply it to the letter. You would be lucky to find a place in Tripoli with a carton of booze under the counter which they dispense to their most loyal customers only.</p>\n<p>What is sure, however, is that this vigilante sharia is creating an even bigger divide in a country that doesn’t need more divisions to begin with, even among Muslims themselves because it’s not really about religion but about ideology. Banning alcohol and pork, which slowly turns places in a country that falls more on the liberal side in this deeply conservative region, slowly disassociates regions from each other: turning some more extreme while others become more liberal, the cultural and sectarian divide growing even bigger. The conservatives, subsequently, become more conservative. The less conservative folk become less so and the merry goes round. The clash between these ideologies would grow stronger.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it is ZWZ’s right not to serve alcohol and pork on some of its premises. But when there’s no regulation to dictate this, the question asks itself: what’s the limit for this sort of “freedom” for restaurants? When does imposing restrictions on others, even those who share your religious views, crosses the line of freedom? And is it truly permissible to say that, due to the presence of alternatives, discussing the presence of Sharia-abiding restaurants should not be allowed?</p>\n<p> </p>');
